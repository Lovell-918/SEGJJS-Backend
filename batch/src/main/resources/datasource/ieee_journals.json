In particular, regardless of the training algorithms, the learned embeddings have often been shown to be generalizable to different NLP tasks. In contrast, despite recent momentum on word embeddings for source code, the literature lacks evidence of their generalizability beyond the example task they have been trained for. In this experience paper, we identify 3 potential downstream tasks, namely code comments generation, code authorship identification, and code clones detection, that source code token embedding models can be applied to. We empirically assess a recently proposed code token embedding model, namely code2vec's token embeddings. Code2vec was trained on the task of predicting method names, and while there is potential for using the vectors it learns on other tasks, it has not been explored in literature. Therefore, we fill this gap by focusing on its generalizability for the tasks we have identified. Eventually, we show that source code token embeddings cannot be readily leveraged for the downstream tasks. Our experiments even show that our attempts to use them do not result in any improvements over less sophisticated methods. We call for more research into effective and general use of code embeddings.", "author": [{"name": "Hong Jin Kang", "affiliation": "Singapore Management University"}, {"name": "Tegawend\u00e9 F.

In past work (D.

In this paper, we report on a tool for analyzing TRIO specifications taking advantage of their modular structure, overcoming the well-known state-explosion problem and making the proposed method really scalable. We discuss the fundamental operations and the algorithms on which the tool is based. Then we illustrate its use in a realistic case study inspired by an industrial application.

Scientific computing traditionally is carried out by mathematical modelers who write their own Fortran programs. As faster machines and new architectures make more complex problems computationally feasible, programming becomes more cost effective. Scientific computing comprises a variety of activities including model formulation, coding, and interpretation. The SINAPSE program synthesis system illustrates the use of knowledge-based techniques in model solution. SINAPSE is designed to be part of a problem-solving environment for forward modeling that includes several additional scientific programming activities. SINAPSE generates code by applying refinements and optimizing transformations, first producing an algorithm description and then an array-based, high-level language program before generating target code. SINAPSE generates implementations targeted toward a specified architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "E.

To address this problem, we propose AutoFocus, an automated approach for rating and visualizing the importance of input elements based on their effects on the outputs of the networks. The approach is built on our hypotheses that (1) attention mechanisms incorporated into neural networks can generate discriminative scores for various input elements and (2) the discriminative scores reflect the effects of input elements on the outputs of the networks. This paper verifies the hypotheses by applying AutoFocus on the task of algorithm classification (i.e., given a program source code as input, determine the algorithm implemented by the program). AutoFocus identifies and perturbs code elements in a program systematically, and quantifies the effects of the perturbed elements on the network's classification results. Based on evaluation on more than 1000 programs for 10 different sorting algorithms, we observe that the attention scores are highly correlated to the effects of the perturbed code elements. Such a correlation provides a strong basis for the uses of attention scores to interpret the relations between code elements and the algorithm classification results of a neural network, and we believe that visualizing code elements in an input program ranked according to their attention scores can facilitate faster program comprehension with reduced code.", "author": [{"name": "Nghi D.

Category theory has been explored as framework for providing this structure, and has been successfully used to compose specifications. This work has typically adopted a \"correct-by-construction\" approach: components are specified, proved correct and then composed together in such a way as to preserve their properties. However, in a large project, it is desirable to be able to mix specification and composition steps such that, at any particular moment in the process, we may have established only some of the properties of the components and some of the composition relations.

Currently, the utility industry has no automated tools to generate schedules that are both safe and resource-efficient. We focused on safety constraints since they are critical in this application. There are several aspects of this project that go beyond previous applications of KIDS to scheduling problems. First, scheduling of outages of power plants has a planning-like character since the scheduler needs to represent and maintain the complex state of the plant at all times considered during the scheduling process. Second, the particular safety constraints we considered required scheduling a pool of resources in the presence of time windows on each activity. To our knowledge the control and data structures that we developed for handling such a pool are novel. In terms of design knowledge, the outage scheduling problem is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem and the synthesized algorithm is an instance of global search with constraint propagation. The derivation of specialized representations for the constraints to perform efficient propagation is a key aspect of our approach. In addition, finite differencing complements constraint propagation by efficiently maintaining the state of the world.", "author": [{"name": "C.P.

The authors show that straightforward formalization, persistently applied at all levels of system description and system derivation, produces a scalable architecture for a synthesis environment. The primitive building blocks for framework are specifications, which encapsulate types and operations, and specification arrows, which are relations between specifications. The design of a system is represented as a diagram of specifications and arrows. Synthesis steps manipulate such diagrams, for example, by adding design detail to some specification, or by building new diagrams. A design history is a diagram of diagrams.

Despite the numerous GUI-based test input generation techniques proposed in the literature, these techniques are still limited by (1) lack of context-aware text inputs; (2) failing to generate expressive tests; and (3) absence of test oracles. To address these limitations, we propose CraftDroid, a framework that leverages information retrieval, along with static and dynamic analysis techniques, to extract the human knowledge from an existing test suite for one app and transfer the test cases and oracles to be used for testing other apps with the similar functionalities. Evaluation of CraftDroid on real-world commercial Android apps corroborates its effectiveness by achieving 73% precision and 90% recall on average for transferring both the GUI events and oracles.

The system tests poorly-encapsulated Ada units against formal specifications. This task is difficult partly because the unit's interface is not explicit, but rather is buried in the body/implementation code. We attack this problem by making the unit's interface explicit and complete. This is accomplished via automatic and manual analysis of the body. The complete interface is represented using an extended algebraic signature notation. Once the signature has been discovered, it can be reformulated so that a collection of well-defined, static mappings are established between it and the signature of the unit's formal specification. These mappings guide the development of test artifact transformers and oracles, which support automatic test data selection, execution and result verification. This paper discusses problems that arise as a result of testing under low encapsulation, discusses our solution using an ongoing example, and compares our solution to earlier solutions.", "author": [{"name": "A.A.

The domain-independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very efficient in any one given domain. The domain-dependent approaches can be very efficient for the domain for which they are designed, but would need to be written separately for each domain of interest. The tediousness and the error-proneness of manual coding have hither-to inhibited work on domain-dependent planners. In this paper we describe a novel way of automating the development of domain dependent planners using knowledge-based software synthesis tools. Specifically, we describe an architecture called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used in conjunction with a declarative theory of domain independent planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific to a given domain, to semi-automatically derive customized planning code. We discuss what it means to write declarative theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate it by generating a range of domain-specific planners using state space and plan space refinements. We demonstrate that the synthesized planners can have superior performance compared to classical refinement planners using the same control knowledge.", "author": [{"name": "Biplav Srivastava", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"}, {"name": "Subbarao Kambhampati", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"}, {"name": "A.D.

To reduce this effort, and thus the overall cost of mobile app testing, we propose APPTESTMIGRATOR, a technique for migrating test cases between apps in the same category (e.g., banking apps). The intuition behind APPTESTMIGRATOR is that many apps share similarities in their functionality, and these similarities often result in conceptually similar user interfaces (through which that functionality is accessed). APPTESTMIGRATOR leverages these commonalities between user interfaces to migrate existing tests written for an app to another similar app. Specifically, given (1) a test case for an app (source app) and (2) a second app (target app), APPTESTMIGRATOR attempts to automatically transform the sequence of events and oracles in the test for the source app to events and oracles for the target app. We implemented APPTESTMIGRATOR for Android mobile apps and evaluated it on a set of randomly selected apps from the Google Play Store in four different categories.

Our theory-based object model formally defines object-oriented concepts in terms of algebraic theories and category theory operations.

We have developed a family of methods, called Dependency Detection, for analyzing execution traces for small patterns. Unfortunately, these methods provide only a local view of program behavior. The approach described here integrates two methods, dependency detection and CHAID-based analysis, to produce an abstract model of system behavior: a transition diagram of merged states. We present the algorithm and demonstrate it on synthetic examples and data from two AI planning and control systems. The models produced by the algorithm summarize sequences and cycles evident in the synthesized models and highlight some key aspects of behavior in the two systems.

This renders them unusually difficult to specify and even to state requirements for. In the ISAT project (Hall, 1992) end-user requirements are stated as concrete behavior scenarios, and a multi-functional apprentice system aids the human developer in acquiring and maintaining a knowledge-based specification consistent with the scenarios. This paper describes ISAT's novel approach to validating the acquired specification by using sound scenario generalization to construct descriptions of scenario classes with guaranteed behavior. It also describes the key technical problems that must be solved in order to implement sound scenarios generalization using explanation-based techniques, as well as ISAT's solution to the problems. The approach is implemented and has been tested on two reactive systems; an email system and a telephone switching system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "R.

For the specification of such a system a precise consideration of the user's context during each step of the development process is therefore necessary. Moreover, a formal specification method for expressing interaction is highly desirable in order to achieve a precise and continuous specification process between the requirements and design stages. In this paper several of the environmental cues influencing the user during the interaction with a system are considered. These environmental cues are modelled using the concept of information resources. Interaction is described using these resources and formally specified by the notation of graph grammars in order to be able to reason about a system, to assess a system wrt important properties and, finally to achieve a continuous specification process between the requirements and design stages. This approach will be demonstrated by specifying a safety-critical system concerning the interaction between the pilot and the flight management system on the flight deck of an aircraft.", "author": [{"name": "B.E.

Although it offers great convenience for both app developers and mobile users, this feature was frequently reported to serve malicious and aggressive purposes, such as delivering annoying push notification advertisement. However, to the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been studied by our research community so far. To fill the void, this paper presents the first study to detect aggressive push notifications and further characterize them in the global mobile app ecosystem on a large scale. To this end, we first provide a taxonomy of mobile push notifications and identify the aggressive ones using a crowdsourcing-based method. Then we propose sc DaPanda, a novel hybrid approach, aiming at automatically detecting aggressive push notifications in Android apps. sc DaPanda leverages a guided testing approach to systematically trigger and record push notifications. By instrumenting the Android framework, sc DaPanda further collects all notification-relevant runtime information to flag the aggressive ones. Our experimental results show that sc DaPanda is capable of detecting different types of aggressive push notifications effectively in an automated way. By applying sc DaPanda to 20,000 Android apps from different app markets, it yields over 1,000 aggressive notifications, which have been further confirmed as true positives. Our in-depth analysis further reveals that aggressive notifications are prevalent across different markets and could be manifested in all the phases in the lifecycle of push notifications. It is hence urgent for our community to take actions to detect and mitigate apps involving aggressive push notifications.", "author": [{"name": "Tianming Liu", "affiliation": "Beijing University of

Tools must be both reliable and offer real assistance to the user. Logical frameworks are a suitable medium to build such tools, since they provide a means to show the faithfulness and adequacy of the implementation, and at the same time provide the flexibility needed to build sufficiently automated tools. We present Z-in-Isabelle, a deep semantic embedding of the specification language Z and a deductive system for Z in the generic theorem prover Isabelle. Z is based on Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and first-order predicate logic, extended by a notion of schemas. Isabelle supports a fragment of higher-order predicate logic, in which object logics such as Z can be encoded as theories. We illustrate the use of Z-in-Isabelle with a data refinement proof. We assess to what extent such proofs need to and can be automated to make implementations in logical frameworks such as Z-in-Isabelle viable tools for reasoning about specifications.", "author": [{"name": "I.

Advances in the support of upstream activities have focussed on assisting software developers. We examine the possibility of extending computer-based support in the software development process to allow end users to participate, providing feedback directly to developers. The approach uses the notion of \"agents\" developed in artificial intelligence research and concepts of participatory design. Namely, agents monitor end users working with prototype systems and report mismatches between developers' expectations and a system's actual usage. At the same time, the agents provide end users with an opportunity to communicate with developers, either synchronously or asynchronously. The use of agents is based on actual software development experiences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "A.

However, FSSs are incapable of modelling many practical communicating systems, and hence there is interest in a novel class of problems, which we call VIPSs (Value-passing Infinite-state Parameterised Systems). Existing approaches using model checking over FSSs are insufficient for VIPSs, due to their inability both to reason with and about domain-specific theories, and to cope with systems having an unbounded or arbitrary state space. We use the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) with parameterised constants to express and specify VIPSs. We use the laws of CCS to conduct the verification task. This approach allows us to study communicating systems, regardless of their state space, and the data such systems communicate. Automating theorem proving in this system is an extremely difficult task. We provide automated methods for CCS analysis; they are applicable to both FSSs and VIPSs. Adding these methods to the Clam proof-planner, we have implemented an automated theorem prover that is capable of dealing with problems outside the scope of current methods.

However, a user will not willingly put resources (money, privacy, information) at risk unless the assistant can be trusted to carry out the task in accord with the user's goals and priorities. This risk is significant, because assistant behaviors, being idiosyncratic and highly customized, will not be as well supported or documented as is commercial software. This paper describes a solution to this problem, allowing the assistant to safely execute partially trusted behaviors and to interactively increase the user's trust in the behavior so that more of the steps can be carried out autonomously. The approach is independent of how the behavior was acquired and is based on using incremental formal validation to populate a trust library for the behavior.", "author": [{"name": "R.J.

Thanks to the widespread applications, it is crucial to ensure the reliability of the code coverage profilers. Unfortunately, due to the lack of research attention and the existence of testing oracle problem, coverage profilers are far away from being tested sufficiently. Bugs are still regularly seen in the widely deployed profilers, like gcov and llvm-cov, along with gcc and llvm, respectively. This paper proposes Cod, an automated self-validator for effectively uncovering bugs in the coverage profilers. Starting from a test program (either from a compiler's test suite or generated randomly), Cod detects profiler bugs with zero false positive using a metamorphic relation in which the coverage statistics of that program and a mutated variant are bridged. We evaluated Cod over two of the most well-known code coverage profilers, namely gcov and llvm-cov.

The formulation of the search space, the objective function and the constraints will generally have a large impact on the duration of the optimization process as well as the quality of the resulting design. Furthermore, the best formulation will vary from one application domain to another, and from one problem to another within a given application domain. Unfortunately, a design engineer may not know the best formulation in advance of attempting to set up and run a design optimization process. In order to attack this problem, we have developed a software environment that supports interactive formulation, testing and reformulation of design optimization strategies. Our system represents optimization strategies in terms of second-order dataflow graphs. Reformulations of strategies are implemented as transformations between dataflow graphs. The system permits the user to interactively generate and search a space of design optimization strategies, and experimentally evaluate their performance on test problems, in order to find a strategy that is suitable for his application domain. The system has been implemented in a domain independent fashion, and is being tested in the domain of racing yacht design.", "author": [{"name": "T. Euman", "affiliation": "Dept. of Comput.

MULTI-TAC is a program synthesis system that generates Lisp code to solve combinatorial integer constraint satisfaction problems. The use of algorithm schemas enables machine learning techniques to be applied in a very focused manner. These learning techniques enable the system to be sensitive to the distribution of instances that the system is expected to encounter. We describe two applications of machine learning in MULTI-TAC. The system learns domain specific heuristics, and then learns the most effective combination of heuristics on the training instances.

The usual paradigm of formally specifying and then developing and verifying the code is less cost-effective than writing the code and then abstracting it to a level that is suitable for human judgements to be made.

It requires test suites to contain enough test inputs to cover all feasible values for the object's fields within a certain scope (input-size bound). While previous work shows that field-exhaustive suites can be automatically generated, the generation technique required a formal specification of the inputs that can be subject to SAT-based analysis. Moreover, the restriction of producing all feasible values for inputs' fields makes test generation costly. In this paper, we deal with field coverage as testing criteria that measure the quality of a test suite in terms of coverage and mutation score, by examining to what extent the values of inputs' fields are covered. In particular, we consider field coverage in combination with test generation based on symbolic execution to produce underapproximations of field-exhaustive suites, using the Symbolic Pathfinder tool. To underapproximate these suites we use tranScoping, a technique that estimates characteristics of yet to be run analyses for large scopes, based on data obtained from analyses performed in small scopes. This provides us with a suitable condition to prematurely stop the symbolic execution. As we show, tranScoping different metrics regarding field coverage allows us to produce significantly smaller suites using a fraction of the generation time.

Views provide a clean, flexible, and efficient mechanism for combining reusable software components. A view describes how an application data type implements features of an abstract type; it provides a bidirectional mapping between a generic concept and a particular implementation of that concept. Parameterizing a generic procedure by means of views allows a single copy of the procedure to be specialized for a variety of application data types and target languages. Both composition of views and multiple views of the same data as different abstract types are often required. Automated support makes it easy to create views and to generate specialized code for an application in a desired target language. These techniques have been implemented. Examples are presented that illustrate combination of components through views to specialize a generic procedure and to instantiate a software framework.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "G.S.

General-purpose services and facilities foster re-use and help reduce development costs. Yet the degree of automation of the software development process is limited to the generation of skeleton and stub code from component interface specifications given in a common interface definition language (IDL). This is mainly due to the fact that the expressiveness of current IDLs is limited to the specification of type and operation signatures. Important properties of crucial components of security-, safety-critical or reactive applications such as object behavior, timing or synchronization constraints cannot be documented formally, let alone checked automatically. In this paper, we continue developing solutions for adding specifications of semantic properties to component interfaces and automatically synthesizing code that instruments corresponding semantic checks. Independently from the concrete syntax and semantics of such specification elements, we present a collection of design patterns that allow the designer to seamlessly integrate the synthesized code with the code frames generated by standard IDL compilers. We study these approaches along the concrete example of extending CORBA IDL with synchronization constraints and we evaluate several implementations, solely based on standardized features of the CORBA standard.", "author": [{"name": "H.-A.

Numerous studies have shown that automated code analyses are adopted by developers only if they yield a good \"signal to noise ratio\", i.e., high precision. Many previous studies have reported analysis precision quantitatively, but this gives little insight into what can and should be done to increase precision further. To guide future research on increasing precision, we present a comprehensive study that evaluates static Android taint-analysis results on a qualitative level. To unravel the exact nature of taint flows, we have designed COVA, an analysis tool to compute partial path constraints that inform about the circumstances under which taint flows may actually occur in practice. We have conducted a qualitative study on the taint flows reported by FlowDroid in 1,022 real-world Android applications. Our results reveal several key findings: Many taint flows occur only under specific conditions, e.g., environment settings, user interaction, I/O. Taint analyses should consider the application context to discern such situations. COVA shows that few taint flows are guarded by multiple different kinds of conditions simultaneously, so tools that seek to confirm true positives dynamically can concentrate on one kind at a time, e.g., only simulating user interactions. Lastly, many false positives arise due to a too liberal source/sink configuration. Taint analyses must be more carefully configured, and their configuration could benefit from better tool assistance.", "author": [{"name": "Linghui Luo", "affiliation": "Paderborn University, Paderborn, Germany"}, {"name": "Eric Bodden", "affiliation": "Paderborn University & Fraunhofer IEM, Paderborn, Germany"}, {"name": "Johannes Sp\u00e4th", "affiliation": "Fraunhofer IEM, Paderborn, Germany"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Flowdroid: precise context flow field object-sensitive and lifecycle-aware taint analysis for android apps\"", "authors": ["S.

A declarative domain theory defines the semantics of a domain-oriented specification language and its relationship to implementation-level subroutines. Formal specification development and reuse is made accessible to users through an intuitive graphical interface that guides them in creating diagrams denoting formal specifications. Deductive program synthesis ensures that specifications are correctly implemented. This approach has been implemented in AMPHION, a generic KBSE system that targets scientific subroutine libraries. AMPHION has been applied to the domain of solar system kinematics. AMPHION enables space scientists to develop, modify, and reuse specifications an order of magnitude more rapidly than manual program development.

However, the value they add, both in terms of coverage and in fault detection, has been difficult to quantify. Potential cost savings from replacing testing with mathematical techniques cannot be realized until the tradeoffs can be quantified. This paper first describes a framework for a theory of software fault detection that is based on software reliability and formalized fault models. The novelty of this approach is that it takes into account the relative utility of the various tools for fault detection. Second, the paper describes a utility model for integrating mathematical and empirical techniques with respect to fault detection and coverage analysis for software. Third, the paper discusses how to determine the optimal combination of black-box testing, white-box (structural) testing and formal methods in V&V of a software system. Finally, a demonstration of how this utility model can be used in practice is offered using a case study from a NASA software system.", "author": [{"name": "M.

Clusters of related views are needed for specialization of generic programs involving more than one data type. Descriptions of abstract data types allow view clusters to be constructed automatically or semi-automatically by reasoning about the properties of application types. These techniques, which have been implemented using the GLISP language and compiler, allow easy and rapid adaptation of generic procedures for an application by first viewing the application data types as the appropriate abstract types, then specializing the generic procedures by compilation through the view cluster.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "G.S.

As the auditor might need to check hundreds or even thousands of apps, manually exploring each app to trigger the desired behavior is too time-consuming to be feasible. Existing automated application exploration and testing techniques are of limited help in this scenario as well, as their goal is mostly to identify faults by systematically exploring different app paths, rather than swiftly navigating to the target functionality. The goal-driven application exploration approach proposed in this paper, called GoalExplorer, automatically generates an executable test script that directly triggers the functionality of interest. The core idea behind GoalExplorer is to first statically model the application's UI screens and transitions between these screens, producing a Screen Transition Graph (STG). Then, GoalExplorer uses the STG to guide the dynamic exploration of the application to the particular target of interest: an Android activity, API call, or a program statement. The results of our empirical evaluation on 93 benchmark applications and the 95 most popular GooglePlay applications show that the STG is substantially more accurate than other Android UI models and that GoalExplorer is able to trigger a target functionality much faster than existing application exploration techniques.", "author": [{"name": "Duling Lai", "affiliation": "Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"}, {"name": "Julia Rubin", "affiliation": "Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"Effective Real-time Android Application Auditing\"", "authors": ["M.

Specification-based browsing evades this bottleneck by moving any deduction into an off-line indexing phase. In this paper, we show how match relations are used to build an appropriate index and how formal concept analysis is used to build a suitable navigation structure. This structure has the single-focus property (i.e. any sensible subset of a library is represented by a single node) and supports attribute-based (via explicit component properties) and object-based (via implicit component similarities) navigation styles. It thus combines the exact semantics of formal methods with the interactive navigation possibilities of informal methods. Experiments show that current theorem provers can solve enough of the emerging proof problems to make browsing feasible. The navigation structure also indicates situations where additional abstractions are required to build a better index and thus helps to understand and to re-engineer component libraries.", "author": [{"name": "B.

KIV was originally developed for the verification of procedural programs but it serves well for verifying knowledge-based systems. Its specification language is based on abstract data types for the functional specification of components and dynamic logic for the algorithmic specification. It provides an interactive theorem prover integrated into a sophisticated tool environment supporting aspects like the automatic generation of proof obligations, generation of counter examples, proof management, proof reuse etc. Such a support is essential for making the verification of complex specifications feasible.

Reproducing executions of mobile apps, in particular, has proven difficult under real-life scenarios due to multiple sources of external inputs and interactive nature of the apps. Previous works that provide record/replay functionality for mobile apps are restricted to particular input sources (e.g., touchscreen events) and present deployment challenges due to intrusive modifications to the underlying software stack. Moreover, due to their reliance on record and replay of device specific events, the recorded executions cannot be reliably reproduced across different platforms. In this paper, we present a new practical approach, RandR, for record and replay of Android applications. RandR captures and replays multiple sources of input (i.e., UI and network) without requiring source code (OS or app), administrative device privileges, or any special platform support. RandR achieves these qualities by instrumenting a select set of methods at runtime within an application's own sandbox. In addition, to enable portability of recorded executions across different platforms for replay, RandR contextualizes UI events as interactions with particular UI components (e.g., a button) as opposed to relying on platform specific features (e.g., screen coordinates). We demonstrate RandR's accurate cross-platform record and replay capabilities using over 30 real-world Android apps across a variety of platforms including emulators as well as commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices deployed in real life.", "author": [{"name": "Onur Sahin", "affiliation": "Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"}, {"name": "Assel Aliyeva", "affiliation": "Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"}, {"name": "Hariharan Mathavan", "affiliation": "Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"}, {"name": "Ayse Coskun", "affiliation": "Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"}, {"name": "Manuel Egele", "affiliation": "Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"A structured approach to the simulation analysis and characterization of smartphone applications\"", "authors": ["D.

Ninth Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Conference", "keyword": ["Telephony", "Switching systems", "Software libraries", "Software testing", "Prototypes", "Control systems", "Humans", "Switches", "Safety", "Software prototyping"], "abstract": "Validating the specification of a reactive system, such as a telephone switching system, traffic controller, or automated network service, is difficult, primarily because it is extremely hard even to state a complete and correct set of requirements, let alone to prove that a specification satisfies them. A previous paper, R.J. Hall(1993), described a new validation proof technique, sound scenario generalization, which computes and proves a general validation lemma from a specific requirement-scenario and a candidate specification. That paper left open how the user should employ the technique to systematically validate a complete system. This paper describes an approach, based on a novel knowledge structure called a library of generalized scenario fragments, that combines the advantages of traditional software testing and automated theorem proving of specifications, avoiding most of their shortcomings.

Instead of continuing to recreate components that are similar to existing artifacts, and considering the rising costs of development, many organizations would like to decrease software development costs and cycle time by reusing existing OO components. This paper proposes an experiment to verify three hypotheses about the impact of three internal characteristics (inheritance, coupling and complexity) of OO applications on reusability. This verification is done through a machine learning approach (the C4.5 algorithm and a windowing technique).

This paper shows that treating program understanding as plan recognition is too simplistic and that traditional AI search algorithms for plan recognition are not suitable.

This approach groups together functions, types, and variables into ADT and ASE candidates according to the proportion of features they share. The set of features considered includes the context of these elements, the relationships to their environment, and informal information. A prototype tool has been implemented to support this approach. It has been applied to three C systems (each between 30-38 Kloc). The ADTs and ASEs identified by the approach are compared to those identified by software engineers who did not know the proposed approach. In a case study, this approach has been shown to identify, in most cases, more ADTs and ASEs than five published techniques applied on the same systems. This is important when trying to identify as many ADTs and ASEs as possible.", "author": [{"name": "J.-F.

However, existing approaches use either syntax-based features which can be evaded by transformation attacks or semantic-based features which are usually extracted by performing expensive program analysis. Therefor, in this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-based approach to perform Android malware detection. Instead of traditional heavyweight static analysis, we treat function call graphs of apps as social networks and perform social-network-based centrality analysis to represent the semantic features of the graphs. Our key insight is that centrality provides a succinct and fault-tolerant representation of graph semantics, especially for graphs with certain amount of inaccurate information (e.g., inaccurate call graphs). We implement a prototype system, MalScan, and evaluate it on datasets of 15,285 benign samples and 15,430 malicious samples. Experimental results show that MalScan is capable of detecting Android malware with up to 98% accuracy under one second which is more than 100 times faster than two state-of-the-art approaches, namely MaMaDroid and Drebin. We also demonstrate the feasibility of MalScan on market-wide malware scanning by performing a statistical study on over 3 million apps. Finally, in a corpus of dataset collected from Google-Play app market, MalScan is able to identify 18 zero-day malware including malware samples that can evade detection of existing tools.", "author": [{"name": "Yueming Wu", "affiliation": "Cluster and Grid Computing Lab Services Computing Technology and System Lab, National Engineering Research Center for Big Data Technology and System"}, {"name": "Xiaodi Li", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Dallas"}, {"name": "Deqing Zou", "affiliation": "Cluster and Grid Computing Lab Services Computing Technology and System Lab, National Engineering Research Center for Big Data Technology and System"}, {"name": "Wei Yang", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Dallas"}, {"name": "Xin Zhang", "affiliation": "Cluster and Grid Computing Lab Services Computing Technology and System Lab, National Engineering Research Center for Big Data Technology and System"}, {"name": "Hai Jin", "affiliation": "Cluster and Grid Computing Lab Services Computing Technology and System Lab, National Engineering Research Center for Big Data Technology and System"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Using probabilistic generative models for ranking risks of android apps\"", "authors": ["H.

Unfortunately, such \"legacy\" analysis codes are frequently unsuitable for use in automated design. They may crash for large classes of input, be numerically unstable or locally non-smooth, or be highly sensitive to control parameters. To be useful, analysis programs must be modified to reduce or eliminate only the undesired behaviors, without altering the desired computation. To do this by direct modification of the programs is labor-intensive, and necessitates costly revalidation. We have implemented a high-level language and runtime environment that allow failure-handling strategies to be incorporated into existing Fortran and C analysis programs while preserving their computational integrity. Our approach relies on globally managing the execution of these programs at the level of discretely callable functions so that the computation is only affected when problems are detected. Problem handling procedures are constructed from a knowledge base of generic problem management strategies. We show that our approach is effective in improving analysis program robustness and design optimization performance in the domain of conceptual design of jet engine nozzles.", "author": [{"name": "J.

Rather than taking the approach of building new languages and environments, a Binder is designed to inter-operate with existing languages and tools. Binders support grammatical extensions to a language (for example, a language to describe architectures or a language to describe processes) that permits the inclusion of uninstantiated descriptions in the language. Design elaboration is performed interactively-the Binder informs the designer as to which elements of the design require further elaboration, and suggests possible ways in which the elaboration may be performed. The Binder relies upon application specific knowledge bases of design constraints to be satisfied, and methods for satisfying those constraints. Two Binders have been developed using the above methodology: an Architecture Binder for developing software architectures from generic architectures, and a Process Binder that supports refinement of generic processes during process enactment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "W.

The relational model makes up for its lower efficiency by a greater expressive power and by optimization of queries, using indexes and other means. However, sophisticated analysis is required in order to take advantage of these features, since converting each database access operation separately does not use the greater expressive power of the target database and does not enable it to perform useful optimizations. By analyzing the behavior of the host program around the database access operations, it is possible to discover patterns such as filtering, joins and aggregative operations. It is then possible to remove those operations from the host program and re-implement them in the target database query language. This paper describes an automatic system, called MIDAS (MIgrator of Database Application Systems), that performs high-quality reengineering of legacy database programs in this way. The results of MIDAS were found to be superior to those of the naive one-to-one translation in terms of readability, size, speed and network data traffic.", "author": [{"name": "Y.

Due to the crowdsourcing nature of these Q&A sites, many user-provided answers are wrong, less optimal or out-of-date. Relying on community-curated quality indicators (e.g., accepted answer, answer vote) cannot reliably identify these answer problems. Such problematic answers are often criticized by other users. However, these critiques are not readily discoverable when reading the posts. In this paper, we consider the answers being criticized and their critique posts as controversial discussions in community Q&A sites. To help developers notice such controversial discussions and make more informed choices of appropriate solutions, we design an automatic open information extraction approach for systematically discovering and summarizing the controversies in Stack Overflow and exploiting official API documentation to assist the understanding of the discovered controversies. We apply our approach to millions of java/android-tagged Stack overflow questions and answers and discover a large scale of controversial discussions in Stack Overflow. Our manual evaluation confirms that the extracted controversy information is of high accuracy. A user study with 18 developers demonstrates the usefulness of our generated controversy summaries in helping developers avoid the controversial answers and choose more appropriate solutions to programming questions.", "author": [{"name": "Xiaoxue Ren", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"}, {"name": "Zhenchang Xing", "affiliation": "Research School of Computer Science, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"}, {"name": "Xin Xia", "affiliation": "Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"}, {"name": "Guoqiang Li", "affiliation": "School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"}, {"name": "Jianling Sun", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Evaluating and predicting answer quality in community qa\"", "authors": ["C.

This paper presents an approach, based on formal methods, to the modification of reusable software components. From a two-tiered hierarchy of reusable software components, the existing components that are more general than the query specification are retrieved from the hierarchy. The specification for a more general retrieved component is compared to the query specification to determine what changes need to be applied to the corresponding program component in order to make it satisfy the query specification.

To alleviate the labor burden in replying to the bulk of user reviews, developers usually adopt a template-based strategy where the templates can express appreciation for using the app or mention the company email address for users to follow up. However, reading a large number of user reviews every day is not an easy task for developers. Thus, there is a need for more automation to help developers respond to user reviews. Addressing the aforementioned need, in this work we propose a novel approach RRGen that automatically generates review responses by learning knowledge relations between reviews and their responses. RRGen explicitly incorporates review attributes, such as user rating and review length, and learns the relations between reviews and corresponding responses in a supervised way from the available training data. Experiments on 58 apps and 309,246 review-response pairs highlight that RRGen outperforms the baselines by at least 67.4% in terms of BLEU-4 (an accuracy measure that is widely used to evaluate dialogue response generation systems). Qualitative analysis also confirms the effectiveness of RRGen in generating relevant and accurate responses.", "author": [{"name": "Cuiyun Gao", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"}, {"name": "Jichuan Zeng", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"}, {"name": "Xin Xia", "affiliation": "Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Australia"}, {"name": "David Lo", "affiliation": "School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore"}, {"name": "Michael R.

The hard problem is providing computer support for such collaborative activities. The WinWin approach being developed and experimented at the USC Center for Software Engineering provides a domain independent solution for the stakeholders to cooperate in the requirements engineering phase of the software lifecycle. A major problem confronted in the WinWin framework is aiding decision coordination-coordinating the decision making activities of the stakeholders. A key element in supporting decision coordination is decision maintenance. As decisions undergo evolution, the effects of such changes on existing decision elements must be determined and the decision structure appropriately revised. The paper presents an approach to addressing the problem of supporting decision maintenance. The key ideas involve a) defining an extended ontology for decision rationale, that models the WinWin decision space and their states, b) formally describing a theory based on that ontology that specify conditions for states to hold, and c) defining an agent that utilizes the theory to determine revisions and coordinate with other agents to propagate revisions in a distributed support framework.", "author": [{"name": "P.

First, task-orientation supports the dynamic composition of repository information with respect to a designer's working context. Second, similarity-based retrieval overcomes the impediment of exact matching. When a requested repository item is not available, it supports the search for closely related items by means of matching criteria and relationships. The algorithm uses domain taxonomies to measure the virtual distance between items, rather than applying artificial numerical measures. Moreover, the criteria for calling repository items similar are determined and formulated by the user in the query, rather than being hard-wired into the retrieval interface. The combination of both features furnishes a visibility concept, that allows designers to identify design information for their specific job at hand.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "D.

Tool-supported specification modelling helps software engineers design such systems correctly. One such tool is a scenario generator, which constructs an input event sequence for the spec model that reaches a state satisfying given criteria. It can uncover counterexamples to desired safety properties, explain feature interactions in concrete terms to requirements analysts, and even provide online help to end users learning how to use a system. However, while exhaustive search algorithms work in limited domains, the problem is highly intractable for the functionally rich models that correspond naturally to complex systems engineers wish to design. This paper describes a novel heuristic approach to the problem that is applicable to a large class of infinite state reactive systems. The key idea is to piece together scenarios that achieve subgoals into a single scenario achieving the conjunction of the subgoals. The scenarios are mined from a library captured independently during requirements acquisition. Explanation-based generalization then abstracts them so they may be coinstantiated and interleaved. The approach is implemented, and I present the results of applying the tool to tasks arising from a case study of telephony feature interactions.", "author": [{"name": "R.J.

Bounded obligations facilitate the expression of requirements such as 'a user must return a book on or before its due date'. The implementation translates a simple, declarative form of a bounded obligation into the equivalent data structures and operations necessary to ensure its adherence. Incremental development and exploration is achieved by modifying a 'strict' bounded obligation to become 'violatable' together with a way of recognizing when it has been violated. Again, a simple declaration to this effect is appropriately translated by the implementation. Finally, response to such violations can also be declared and automatically translated into running code. The implementation is described and illustrated on examples drawn from a simple library system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "M.

When creating a PR, developers can add a free-form description to describe what changes are made in this PR and/or why. Such a description is helpful for reviewers and other developers to gain a quick understanding of the PR without touching the details and may reduce the possibility of the PR being ignored or rejected. However, developers sometimes neglect to write descriptions for PRs. For example, in our collected dataset with over 333K PRs, more than 34% of the PR descriptions are empty. To alleviate this problem, we propose an approach to automatically generate PR descriptions based on the commit messages and the added source code comments in the PRs. We regard this problem as a text summarization problem and solve it using a novel sequence-to-sequence model. To cope with out-of-vocabulary words in software artifacts and bridge the gap between the training loss function of the sequence-to-sequence model and the evaluation metric ROUGE, which has been shown to correspond to human evaluation, we integrate the pointer generator and directly optimize for ROUGE using reinforcement learning and a special loss function. We build a dataset with over 41K PRs and evaluate our approach on this dataset through ROUGE and a human evaluation.

Because evolution is a particularly intense form of reuse, what we say will also impact on reusability. We demonstrate our approach using a formal specification, written in the Z formal specification language, for an aerospace application known as the RSDIMU (Redundant Strapped Down Inertial Measurement Unit). We show that articulating the decision structure and associating it with the artifact produced can be used in the subsequent evolution of the specification. We propose a representation which separates domain knowledge into a decision/issue space and an object space and the solution space into object instances, Z schemas and resolved issues, We show the effect of several changes to the RSDIMU specification and demonstrate how different methods of resolving an issue change the focus of attention within the specifications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "C.

The analysis is performed on an abstraction of the original requirements specification. Abstractions in the model may lead to spurious errors in the analysis output. Spurious errors are conditions that are reported as errors, but information abstracted out of the model precludes the reported conditions from being satisfied. A high ratio of spurious errors to true errors in the analysis output makes it difficult, error-prone, and time consuming to find and correct the true errors. We describe an iterative and integrative approach for analyzing state-based requirements that capitalizes on the strengths of a symbolic analysis component and a reasoning component while circumventing their weaknesses. The resulting analysis method is fast enough and automated enough to be used on a day-to-day basis by practicing engineers, and generates analysis reports with a small ratio of spurious errors to true errors.", "author": [{"name": "B.J.

We have built an automatic translation system for converting IBM 370 assembly-language programs to C, in order to port the original programs to different architectures. This system, called Bogart, first analyzes the original program in terms of data flow and control flow, and translates it into an abstract internal representation. It performs various transformations on the abstract representation, and finally re-implements it in the target language. Bogart was successfully tested on several large modules with thousands of lines of assembly code each, taken from a commercial database system and application generator. The results of this research are compared with the brute-force approach first implemented by the company, showing Bogart to be superior on all counts. This research is unusual in that it took place in industry, and had a clear objective of translating a real program and not just demonstrating the feasibility of the approach in an academic setting.

This paper describes the Interactive Code Understanding Environment (ICUE, pronounced \"IQ\"), a graphical environment that supports the exploration of code and code relationships and allows the capture of significant relationships in the form of reusable graphical diagrams. ICUE provides a user with the ability to query a comprehensive code database generated from source code, view the results of queries in the form of graphs, interactively expand the graphs, hide unwanted information in several ways, and examine source code easily and directly from the graphs. ICUE also provides a mechanism for annotating, saving and manipulating these graphs to facilitate the capture of code-level software understanding as a library of such annotated graphs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "P.G.

Domain-oriented software synthesis technology enables software designers to encode their own specific knowledge of software design into transformation rules. Thus, generated software is optimal and actually usable for the domain. However, the optimal implementation cannot be decided in advance if performance specifications, e.g., memory size limits and execution time limits, are unclear. That is, it is difficult to develop transformation rules which generate optimal software for their domain or situation if performance requirements are unclear beforehand. This paper proposes a method of trade-off design in software synthesis, and applies this method to develop a file access program generator called POT-DB. The proposed method includes procedures for: extracting trade-off parameters as input specifications; designing transformation rules for trade-off parameters to generate programs; and designing performance measurement rules to allow designers to notice the effects of trade-off parameters. Based on the results of applying POT-DB in developing a sales analysis and ordering system, all performance requirements have been satisfied, and application productivity has been improved 1.9 times.", "author": [{"name": "A.

However, despite giving good coverage, the test cases may miss the gap between functional specification and the code implementation. This gap may be subtle in nature, arising due to the absence of logical checks, either in the implementation or in the specification, resulting in inconsistencies in the input definition. The inconsistencies may be prevalent especially for structured inputs, commonly specified using string-based data types. Our study on defects reported over popular libraries reveals that such gaps may not be limited to input validation checks. We propose a test generation technique for structured string inputs where we infer inconsistencies in input definition to expose semantic gaps in the method under test and the method specification. We assess this technique using our tool SEGATE, Semantic Gap Tester. SEGATE uses static analysis and automaton modeling to infer the gap and generate test cases. On our benchmark dataset, comprising of defects reported in 15 popular open-source libraries, written in Java, SEGATE was able to generate tests to expose 80% of the defects.", "author": [{"name": "Devika Sondhi", "affiliation": "IIIT Delhi, New Delhi, India"}, {"name": "Rahul Purandare", "affiliation": "IIIT Delhi, New Delhi, India"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Coverage-based grey-box fuzzing as markov chain\"", "authors": ["M.

The informality of feature-based software classification schemes is an impediment to formally verifying the reusability of a software component. The use of formal specifications to model and retrieve reusable components alleviates the informality, but the formal reasoning required for retrieval introduces questions of scalability. To provide scalability, current retrieval systems resort to syntactic classification at some level of abstraction, abandoning the semantic information provided by the specification. We propose a methodology that shifts the overhead of formal reasoning from the retrieval to the classification phase of reuse. Software components are classified using semantic features that are derived from their formal specification. Retrieval of functionally similar components can then be accomplished based on the stored feature sets. Formal verification can be applied to precisely determine the reusability of the set of similar components.", "author": [{"name": "J.

This paper describes such an environment that supports programmer and system cooperating to extract an object-oriented design from legacy software systems. It combines an automated program understanding component that recognizes standard implementations of domain independent plans with with a structured notebook that the programmer uses to link object-oriented design primitives to arbitrary source code fragments.

The most important barrier to use and reuse is that of conceptualization. The Inscape environment is a specification-based software development environment integrated by the constructive use of formal interface specifications. The purpose of the formal interface specifications and the semantic interconnections is to make explicit the invisible semantic dependencies that result in conventionally-built systems. The important ingredient provided by Inquire in conceptualization, retrieval, selection and use is the set of predicates that describe the semantics of the elements in the interface. These predicates define the abstractions that are germane to the module interface and describe the properties of data objects and the assumptions and results of operations in a module. Use and reuse of components is based on a component's ability to provide needed semantics at a particular point in a system. It is the purpose of Inquire, the browser and predicate-based search mechanism, to aid both the environment and the user in the search for the components that will provide the desired predicates that are required to build and evolve an implementation correctly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "D.

When errors occur, error-handling code must execute flawlessly to facilitate system recovery. Implementing correct error handling is repetitive but non-trivial, and developers often inadvertently introduce bugs into error-handling code. Existing tools require correct error specifications to detect error-handling bugs. Manually generating error specifications is error-prone and tedious, while automatically mining error specifications is hard to achieve a satisfying accuracy. In this paper, we propose EH-Miner, a novel and practical tool that can automatically detect error-handling bugs without the need for error specifications. Given a function, EH-Miner mines its error-handling rules when the function is frequently checked by an equivalent condition, and handled by the same action. We applied EH-Miner to 117 applications across 15 software domains. EH-Miner mined error-handling rules with the precision of 91.1% and the recall of 46.9%. We reported 142 bugs to developers, and 106 bugs had been confirmed and fixed at the time of writing. We further applied EH-Miner to Linux kernel, and reported 68 bugs for kernel-4.17, of which 42 had been confirmed or fixed.", "author": [{"name": "Zhouyang Jia", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology Changsha, China"}, {"name": "Shanshan Li", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology Changsha, China"}, {"name": "Tingting Yu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky Lexington, USA"}, {"name": "Xiangke Liao", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology Changsha, China"}, {"name": "Ji Wang", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology Changsha, China"}, {"name": "Xiaodong Liu", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology Changsha, China"}, {"name": "Yunhuai Liu", "affiliation": "Big Data Research Center, Peking University, Beijing, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Designing robust java programs with exceptions\"", "authors": ["M.

One way that instructors can efficiently grade is to construct a custom instructor test suite that compares a student submission to a reference solution over randomly generated or hand-crafted inputs. However, such test suite is often insufficient, causing incorrect submissions to be marked as correct. To address this issue, we propose the Grasa (GRAding-based test Suite Augmentation) approach consisting of two techniques. Grasa first detects and clusters incorrect submissions by approximating their behavioral equivalence to each other. To augment the existing instructor test suite, Grasa generates a minimal set of additional tests that help detect the incorrect submissions. We evaluate our Grasa approach on a dataset of CS1 student submissions for three programming problems. Our preliminary results show that Grasa can effectively identify incorrect student submissions and minimally augment the instructor test suite.", "author": [{"name": "Jonathan Osei-Owusu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, {"name": "Angello Astorga", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, {"name": "Liia Butler", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, {"name": "Tao Xie", "affiliation": "Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University)"}, {"name": "Geoffrey Challen", "affiliation": "Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University)"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Generation CS: The growth of computer science\"", "authors": ["T Camp", " W.

We take a semantic approach and show that a schema can be formalised as an open (first-order) logical theory that contains an open logic program.

Currently, researchers often rely on textual communication records to extract emotion states using natural language processing techniques. However, how well these extracted emotion states reflect people's real emotions has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we report a multi-level, longitudinal empirical study with 82 individual members in 27 project teams. We collected their self-reported retrospective emotion states on a weekly basis during their year-long projects and also extracted corresponding emotions from the textual communication records. We then model and compare the dynamics of these two types of emotions using multiple statistical and time series analysis methods. Our analyses yield a rich set of findings. The most important one is that the dynamics of emotions extracted using text-based algorithms often do not well reflect the dynamics of self-reported retrospective emotions. Besides, the extracted emotions match self-reported retrospective emotions better at the team-level. Our results also suggest that individual personalities and the team's emotion display norms significantly impact the match/mismatch.

A hypermedia tool called I-Doc allows software engineers to post queries about a software system, and generates focused explanations in response. These explanations are task-oriented, i.e., they are sensitive to the software engineering task being performed by the user that led to the query. Task orientation leads to more effective explanations, and is particularly helpful for understanding large software systems. Empirical studies of inquiry episodes were conducted in order to investigate this claim; the kinds of questions users ask, their relation to the user's task and level of expertise. The I-Doc tool is being developed to embody these principles, employing knowledge-based techniques.

Programmers can use relational programming languages to express computations, independent of data representation decisions, and then use the data structure language to specify representations for the relations in their programs. A compiler is described that translates operations on relations represented by composite data structures.

These code snippets often contain ambiguous undeclared external references. Such external references make it difficult to learn and use those APIs correctly. In particular, reusing code snippets containing such ambiguous undeclared external references requires significant manual efforts and expertise to resolve them. Manually resolving fully qualified names (FQN) of API elements is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we propose a novel context-sensitive technique, called COSTER, to resolve FQNs of API elements in such code snippets. The proposed technique collects locally specific source code elements as well as globally related tokens as the context of FQNs, calculates likelihood scores, and builds an occurrence likelihood dictionary (OLD). Given an API element as a query, COSTER captures the context of the query API element, matches that with the FQNs of API elements stored in the OLD, and rank those matched FQNs leveraging three different scores: likelihood, context similarity, and name similarity scores. Evaluation with more than 600K code examples collected from GitHub and two different Stack Overflow datasets shows that our proposed technique improves precision by 4-6% and recall by 3-22% compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed technique significantly reduces the training time compared to the StatType, a state-of-the-art technique, without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive analyses on results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique.", "author": [{"name": "C M Khaled Saifullah", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, Canada"}, {"name": "Muhammad Asaduzzaman", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Queen\u2019s University, Canada"}, {"name": "Chanchal K.

SIGMA makes use of an extensive store of background domain knowledge to ease the specification acquisition process and to maintain the consistency of an evolving specification. In addition, SIGMA uses its background knowledge to aid in the execution of specified models.

Existing work for inferring program transformations usually rely on statistical information over a potentially large set of program-change examples. However, in many practical scenarios we do not have such a large set of program-change examples. In this paper, we address the challenge of inferring a program transformation from one single example. Our core insight is that \"big code\" can provide effective guide for the generalization of a concrete change into a program transformation, i.e., code elements appearing in many files are general and should not be abstracted away. We first propose a framework for transformation inference, where programs are represented as hypergraphs to enable fine-grained generalization of transformations. We then design a transformation inference approach, GENPAT, that infers a program transformation based on code context and statistics from a big code corpus. We have evaluated GENPAT under two distinct application scenarios, systematic editing and program repair. The evaluation on systematic editing shows that GENPAT significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art approach, SYDIT, with up to 5.5x correctly transformed cases. The evaluation on program repair suggests that GENPAT has the potential to be integrated in advanced program repair tools-GENPAT successfully repaired 19 real-world bugs in the Defects4J benchmark by simply applying transformations inferred from existing patches, where 4 bugs have never been repaired by any existing technique. Overall, the evaluation results suggest that GENPAT is effective for transformation inference and can potentially be adopted for many different applications.", "author": [{"name": "Jiajun Jiang", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education (PKU), Peking University, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Luyao Ren", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education (PKU), Peking University, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Yingfei Xiong", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education (PKU), Peking University, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Lingming Zhang", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Dallas, USA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"Discovering and representing systematic code changes\"", "authors": ["M.

A lack of visibility and understanding of the software products, of the processes used for development, and of the resources which serve as inputs to these processes is seen as a major impediment to providing answers to these concerns. This paper outlines an approach to software evaluation based on the use of description/visualization tools and knowledge-based techniques.

However, they often come with performance and code size overhead, resulting in a flexibility vs. efficiency dilemma. The source of inefficiency in software architectures can be identified in the data and control integration of components, because flexibility is present not only at the design level but also in the implementation. We propose the use of program specialization in software engineering as a systematic way to improve performance and in some cases, to reduce program size. In particular, we advocate the use of partial evaluation, which is an automatic technique to produce efficient, specialized instances of generic programs. We study several representative, flexible mechanisms found in software architectures: selective broadcast, pattern matching, interpreters, layers, and generic libraries. We show how partial evaluation can systematically be applied in order to optimize those mechanisms.", "author": [{"name": "R.

In the latter case, the corresponding IFDS data-flow analyses may suffer from false negatives and/or false positives. To improve this, we introduce a sparse alternative to the traditional IFDS algorithm. Instead of propagating the data-flow facts across all the program points along the program's (interprocedural) control flow graph, we propagate every data-flow fact directly to its next possible use points along its own sparse control flow graph constructed on the fly, thus reducing significantly both the time and memory requirements incurred by the traditional IFDS algorithm. In our evaluation, we compare FLOWDROID, a taint analysis performed by using the traditional IFDS algorithm, with our sparse incarnation, SPARSEDROID, on a set of 40 Android apps selected. For the time budget (5 hours) and memory budget (220GB) allocated per app, SPARSEDROID can run every app to completion but FLOWDROID terminates prematurely for 9 apps, resulting in an average speedup of 22.0x. This implies that when used as a market-level vetting tool, SPARSEDROID can finish analyzing these 40 apps in 2.13 hours (by issuing 228 leak warnings) while FLOWDROID manages to analyze only 30 apps in the same time period (by issuing only 147 leak warnings).", "author": [{"name": "Dongjie He", "affiliation": "UNSW Sydney, Australia"}, {"name": "Haofeng Li", "affiliation": "SKL of Computer Architecture, ICT, CAS, China"}, {"name": "Lei Wang", "affiliation": "SKL of Computer Architecture, ICT, CAS, China"}, {"name": "Haining Meng", "affiliation": "SKL of Computer Architecture, ICT, CAS, China"}, {"name": "Hengjie Zheng", "affiliation": "SKL of Computer Architecture, ICT, CAS, China"}, {"name": "Jie Liu", "affiliation": "UNSW Sydney, Australia"}, {"name": "Shuangwei Hu", "affiliation": "Vivo AI Lab, China"}, {"name": "Lian Li", "affiliation": "SKL of Computer Architecture, ICT, CAS, China"}, {"name": "Jingling Xue", "affiliation": "UNSW Sydney, Australia"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"Precise interprocedural dataflow analysis via graph reachability\"", "authors": ["T.

It also detects cost estimate input anomalies and provides risk control advice in addition to conventional COCOMO cost and schedule calculation. It extends previous work by focusing on risk assessment, incorporating substantially more rules, going beyond standard COCOMO, performing quantitative validation, and providing a user-friendly interface. Results of the validation are promising so far, and the method is being used at Litton Data Systems and other industrial environments.

The task is difficult Software processes are inherently creative and dynamic difficult to define and repeat at an enactable level of detail. Additionally, interoperability and reusability have not been considered important issues. Recent interoperability and reusability solutions advocate the development of standard process model representations based on common concepts or generic schemas, which are used as a basis for translating between heterogeneous process representations. The authors propose an alternative approach through the development of process-based components. They present the Open Process Components Framework, a component based framework for software process modeling. In this approach, process models are constructed as sets of components which interact in meaningful ways. Interoperability and reuse are obtained through encapsulation of process representations, an explicit representation of process state, and an extendable set of class relationships.", "author": [{"name": "K.

Android uses this certificate to identify the author and ensure the integrity of an app. However, a number of signature issues have been reported recently, threatening the security and privacy of Android apps. In this paper, we present the first large-scale systematic measurement study on issues related to Android app signatures. We first create a taxonomy covering four types of app signing issues (21 anti-patterns in total), including vulnerabilities, potential attacks, release bugs and compatibility issues. Then we developed an automated tool to characterize signature-related issues in over 5 million app items (3 million distinct apks) crawled from Google Play and 24 alternative Android app markets. Our empirical findings suggest that although Google has introduced apk-level signing schemes (V2 and V3) to overcome some of the known security issues, more than 93% of the apps still use only the JAR signing scheme (V1), which poses great security threats. Besides, we also revealed that 7% to 45% of the apps in the 25 studied markets have been found containing at least one signing issue, while a large number of apps have been exposed to security vulnerabilities, attacks and compatibility issues. Among them a considerable number of apps we identified are popular apps with millions of downloads. Finally, our evolution analysis suggested that most of the issues were not mitigated after a considerable amount of time across markets. The results shed light on the emergency for detecting and repairing the app signing issues.", "author": [{"name": "Haoyu Wang", "affiliation": "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Hongxuan Liu", "affiliation": "Key Lab of High-Confidence Software Technologies (MOE), Peking University, China"}, {"name": "Xusheng Xiao", "affiliation": "Case Western Reserve University"}, {"name": "Guozhu Meng", "affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, SKLOIS, Institute of Information Engineering, China"}, {"name": "Yao Guo", "affiliation": "Key Lab of High-Confidence Software Technologies (MOE), Peking University, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"Beyond google play: A large-scale comparative study of chinese android app markets\"", "authors": ["H.

A comparison of the ten KBSE topic areas to the 21 software engineering education topic areas developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) shows that few of the KBSE requirements are satisfied by the 21 SEI topic areas.

In this paper, we describe such a method for specifying system requirements at the software architecture level. An architecture represents a way breaking down a system into a set of interconnected components. We use architecture theories to specify the behavior of a system in terms of the behavior of its components via a collection of axioms. The axioms describe the effects and limits of component variation and the assumptions a component can make about the environment provided by the architecture. As a result of the method the verification of the basic architecture can be separated from the verification of the individual component instantiations.

However, the OAuth protocol was originally designed for the authorization for third-party websites not to authenticate users in third-party mobile apps. As a result, it is challenging for developers to correctly implement mobile OAuth securely. These vulnerabilities due to the misunderstanding of OAuth and inexperience of developers could lead to data leakage and account breach. In this paper, we perform an empirical study on the usage of OAuth APIs in Android applications and their security implications. In particular, we develop OAUTHLINT, that incorporates a query-driven static analysis to automatically check programs on the Google Play marketplace. OAUTHLINT takes as input an anti-protocol that encodes a vulnerable pattern extracted from the OAuth specifications and a program P. Our tool then generates a counter-example if the anti-protocol can match a trace of Ps possible executions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform a systematic study on 600+ popular apps which have more than 10 millions of downloads. The evaluation shows that 101 (32%) out of 316 applications that use OAuth APIs make at least one security mistake.", "author": [{"name": "Tamjid Al Rahat", "affiliation": "Dept. of Computer Science, University of Virginia, U.S.A"}, {"name": "Yu Feng", "affiliation": "Dept. of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, U.S.A"}, {"name": "Yuan Tian", "affiliation": "Dept. of Computer Science, University of Virginia, U.S.A"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Oauth demystified for mobile application developers\"", "authors": ["Eric Y.

What solutions to the aging software crisis does program understanding offer? One view is that the aging software problem is a form of support for program maintenance. Another view is that the problem of applying program understanding techniques to aging software is one of both extending the life of existing relics, and mining them for valuable components. Yet another view is that domain specific cliches are necessary in program understanding and that program understanding support for software is how programmers can come to understand a program through cooperative interaction with a knowledge base. The work focuses on the flexibility provided by natural language interaction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "author": [{"name": "L.

This makes their maintenance more difficult, more time consuming, and costlier. In order to address these issues, many organizations have been migrating their legacy systems to new technologies. In this paper, we describe a computer-supported approach aimed at supporting the migration of procedural software systems to the object-oriented (OO) technology, which supposedly fosters reusability, expandability, flexibility, encapsulation, information hiding, modularity, and maintainability. Our approach relies heavily on the automatic formation of concepts based on information extracted directly from code to identify objects. The approach tends, thus, to minimize the need for domain application experts. We also propose rules for the identification of OO methods from routines. A well known and self-contained example is used to illustrate the approach. We have applied the approach on medium/large procedural software systems, and the results show that the approach is able to find objects and to identify their methods from procedures and functions.", "author": [{"name": "H.A.

A critical task of compiler testing is to generate test programs that could effectively and efficiently discover bugs. Though we can configure test generators such as Csmith to control the features of the generated programs, it is not clear what test configuration is effective. In particular, an effective test configuration needs to generate test programs that are bug-revealing, i.e., likely to trigger bugs, and diverse, i.e., able to discover different types of bugs. It is not easy to satisfy both properties. In this paper, we propose a novel test-program generation approach, called HiCOND, which utilizes historical data for configuration diversification to solve this challenge. HiCOND first infers the range for each option in a test configuration where bug-revealing test programs are more likely to be generated based on historical data. Then, it identifies a set of test configurations that can lead to diverse test programs through a search method (particle swarm optimization). Finally, based on the set of test configurations for compiler testing, HiCOND generates test programs, which are likely to be bug-revealing and diverse. We have conducted experiments on two popular compilers GCC and LLVM, and the results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. For example, HiCOND detects 75.00%, 133.33%, and 145.00% more bugs than the three existing approaches, respectively. Moreover, HiCOND has been successfully applied to actual compiler testing in a global IT company and detected 11 bugs during the practical evaluation.", "author": [{"name": "Junjie Chen", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"}, {"name": "Guancheng Wang", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University), MoE"}, {"name": "Dan Hao", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University), MoE"}, {"name": "Yingfei Xiong", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University), MoE"}, {"name": "Hongyu Zhang", "affiliation": "The University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia"}, {"name": "Lu Zhang", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University), MoE"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"Finding and understanding bugs in c compilers\"", "authors": ["X.

In this experience paper we tackle the delta debugging problem w.r.t. Kotlin, a relatively new programming language from JetBrains. Our approach is based on a novel combination of program slicing, hierarchical delta debugging and Kotlin-specific transformations, which are synergistic to each other. We implemented it in a prototype called ReduKtor and did extensive evaluation on both synthetic and real Kotlin programs; we also compared its performance with classic delta debugging techniques.

Past research has considered several restricted forms of predicates, including conjunctive predicates and linked predicates, and their detection algorithms. The authors introduce an exclusive OR global predicates to describe exclusive usages of shared resources in distributed programs. An exclusive OR global predicate holds for a given run only when one or zero local predicate is true at every consistent global state during the run. One exclusive OR global predicate is enough to describe the mutual exclusion condition of n processes, while it takes O(n/sup 2/) conjunctive predicates.

As a result organizations that wish to change database vendors are typically forced to rewrite their applications using the new vendor's 4GL. The anticipated cost of this redevelopment can deter an organization from changing vendors, hence denying it the benefits that would otherwise result, e.g., the exploitation of more sophisticated database server technology. If tools existed that could reduce the rewriting effort, the large upfront cost of migrating the organization's applications would also be reduced, which could make the transition economically feasible. The ITOC project is part of a large collaborative research initiative between the Centre for Software Maintenance at the University of Queensland and Oracle Corporation. The objective of this project is to design and implement a tool that automatically recovers both the application structure and the static schema definition of 4GL information system applications. These recovered system components are transformed into constructs that populate Oracle's Designer 2000 CASE repository. An essential component of the ITOC process is to determine the relationships between different columns in the database and between references to those columns and fields that appear within the user interface. This in turn requires analysis of data flow between variables in the 4GL programs. While data flow analysis has been applied in many applications, for example, code optimization and program slicing, this paper presents the results of using data flow analysis in the construction of a novel design recovery tool for 4GL-based information.", "author": [{"name": "J.V.

Many such properties have been extensively studied from the perspective of compiler construction technology. However, live variable analysis, alias analysis and the such are too low level to be of interest to the software engineer. The authors identify a family of statically checkable properties that should represent a higher level abstraction, and reach the detailed design level. Properties in this family which is defined by five precise distinguishing criteria are called traits. Some examples of traits include mutability, const correctness, ownership, and pure functions. In fact, in many ways, traits are non-standard types. They argue that traits should bring about similar benefits to these of static typing in terms of clarity, understandability, adherence to design decisions, and robustness. They further argue that traits can be used for better checking of substitutability in inheritance relationships. Having made the case for traits, they proceed to describing a taxonomy for classifying and understanding traits and show how it can be used to better understand previous work on this topic. The paper also discusses the abstract computational complexity of traits and compares previous research from that perspective.", "author": [{"name": "Y. Gil", "affiliation": "H1-E28, IBM Thomas J.

This is mainly because it separates the error handling code from main business logic. However, the huge space of potential error conditions and the sophisticated logic of cloud systems present a big hurdle to the correct use of exception mechanism. As a result, mistakes in the exception use may lead to severe consequences, such as system downtime and data loss. To address this issue, the communities direly need a better understanding of the exception-related bugs, i.e., eBugs, which are caused by the incorrect use of exception mechanism, in cloud systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on 210 eBugs from six widely-deployed cloud systems, including Cassandra, HBase, HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, YARN, and ZooKeeper. For all the studied eBugs, we analyze their triggering conditions, root causes, bug impacts, and their relations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on eBugs in cloud systems, and the first one that focuses on triggering conditions. We find that eBugs are severe in cloud systems: 74% of our studied eBugs affect system availability or integrity. Luckily, exposing eBugs through testing is possible: 54% of the eBugs are triggered by non-semantic conditions, such as network errors; 40% of the eBugs can be triggered by simulating the triggering conditions at simple system states. Furthermore, we find that the triggering conditions are useful for detecting eBugs. Based on such relevant findings, we build a static analysis tool, called DIET, and apply it to the latest versions of the studied systems. Our results show that DIET reports 31 bugs and bad practices, and 23 of them are confirmed by the developers as \"previously-unknown\" ones.", "author": [{"name": "Haicheng Chen", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, United States"}, {"name": "Wensheng Dou", "affiliation": "State Key Lab of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"}, {"name": "Yanyan Jiang", "affiliation": "State Key Lab for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China"}, {"name": "Feng Qin", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, United States"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"Simple testing can prevent most critical failures: An analysis of production failures in distributed data-intensive systems\"", "authors": ["D.

This idea is very simple but the vast number of arising proof tasks makes a practical implementation very hard. We thus pass the components through a chain of filters of increasing deductive power. In this chain, rejection filters based on signature matching and model checking techniques are used to rule out non-matches as early as possible and to prevent the subsequent ATP from \"drowning\". Hence, intermediate results of reasonable precision are available at (almost) any time of the retrieval process. The final ATP step then works as a confirmation filter to lift the precision of the answer set.

Backend system monitoring cannot detect many types of issues, such as UI related bugs, bugs with small impact on backend system indicators, or errors from third-party co-operating systems, etc. However, users are good informers of such issues: They will provide their feedback for any types of issues. This experience paper discusses our design of iFeedback, a tool to perform real-time issue detection based on user feedback texts. Unlike traditional approaches that analyze user feedback with computation-intensive natural language processing algorithms, iFeedback is focusing on fast issue detection, which can serve as a system life-condition monitor. In particular, iFeedback extracts word combination-based indicators from feedback texts. This allows iFeedback to perform fast system anomaly detection with sophisticated machine learning algorithms. iFeedback then further summarizes the texts with an aim to effectively present the anomaly to the developers for root cause analysis.

{"doi": "10.1109/ASE.2019.00042", "title": "Continuous Incident Triage for Large-Scale Online Service Systems", "publisher": "2019 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)", "keyword": ["Deep learning", "Industries", "Software", "Economics", "Logic gates", "Computer bugs", "Monitoring"], "abstract": "In recent years, online service systems have become increasingly popular. Incidents of these systems could cause significant economic loss and customer dissatisfaction. Incident triage, which is the process of assigning a new incident to the responsible team, is vitally important for quick recovery of the affected service. Our industry experience shows that in practice, incident triage is not conducted only once in the beginning, but is a continuous process, in which engineers from different teams have to discuss intensively among themselves about an incident, and continuously refine the incident-triage result until the correct assignment is reached. In particular, our empirical study on 8 real online service systems shows that the percentage of incidents that were reassigned ranges from 5.43% to 68.26% and the number of discussion items before achieving the correct assignment is up to 11.32 on average. To improve the existing incident triage process, in this paper, we propose DeepCT, a Deep learning based approach to automated Continuous incident Triage. DeepCT incorporates a novel GRU-based (Gated Recurrent Unit) model with an attention-based mask strategy and a revised loss function, which can incrementally learn knowledge from discussions and update incident-triage results. Using DeepCT, the correct incident assignment can be achieved with fewer discussions. We conducted an extensive evaluation of DeepCT on 14 large-scale online service systems in Microsoft. The results show that DeepCT is able to achieve more accurate and efficient incident triage, e.g., the average accuracy identifying the responsible team precisely is 0.641~0.729 with the number of discussion items increasing from 1 to 5. Also, DeepCT statistically significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art bug triage approach.", "author": [{"name": "Junjie Chen", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"}, {"name": "Xiaoting He", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Qingwei Lin", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Hongyu Zhang", "affiliation": "The University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia"}, {"name": "Dan Hao", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, (Peking University), MoE"}, {"name": "Feng Gao", "affiliation": "Microsoft Azure, Redmond, Washington, USA"}, {"name": "Zhangwei Xu", "affiliation": "Microsoft Azure, Redmond, Washington, USA"}, {"name": "Yingnong Dang", "affiliation": "Microsoft Azure, Redmond, Washington, USA"}, {"name": "Dongmei Zhang", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"An empirical investigation of incident triage for online service systems\"", "authors": ["J.

In this paper, we describe how a whole-program automated static analysis technique can be adapted to the validation of individual components, or groups of components, of sequential or concurrent software systems.

To address this problem, existing techniques retrain a DL model over a larger training dataset or with the help of fault injected models or using the insight of failing test cases in a DL model. In this paper, we present Apricot, a novel weight-adaptation approach to fixing DL models iteratively. Our key observation is that if the deep learning architecture of a DL model is trained over many different subsets of the original training dataset, the weights in the resultant reduced DL model (rDLM) can provide insights on the adjustment direction and magnitude of the weights in the original DL model to handle the test cases that the original DL model misclassifies. Apricot generates a set of such reduced DL models from the original DL model. In each iteration, for each failing test case experienced by the input DL model (iDLM), Apricot adjusts each weight of this iDLM toward the average weight of these rDLMs correctly classifying the test case and/or away from that of these rDLMs misclassifying the same test case, followed by training the weight-adjusted iDLM over the original training dataset to generate a new iDLM for the next iteration. The experiment using five state-of-the-art DL models shows that Apricot can increase the test accuracy of these models by 0.87%-1.55% with an average of 1.08%. The experiment also reveals the complementary nature of these rDLMs in Apricot.", "author": [{"name": "Hao Zhang", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"}, {"name": "W.K.

Amphion has a number of advantages, such as the ability to develop a new synthesis system simply by writing a declarative domain theory. However, as a practical matter, the validation of the domain theory for such a system is problematic because the link between generated programs and the domain theory is complex. As a result, when generated programs do not behave as expected, it is difficult to isolate the cause, whether it be an incorrect problem specification or an error in the domain theory. The paper describes a tool being developed that provides formal traceability between specifications and generated code for deductive synthesis systems. It is based on extensive instrumentation of the refutation-based theorem prover used to synthesize programs. It takes augmented proof structures and abstracts them to provide explanations of the relation between a specification, a domain theory, and synthesized code. In generating these explanations, the tool exploits the structure of Amphion domain theories, so the end user is not confronted with the intricacies of raw proof traces. This tool is crucial for the validation of domain theories as well as being important in every-day use of the code synthesis system.", "author": [{"name": "J.

Existing student feedback generation techniques are limited because they either require manual effort in the form of providing an error model, or require a large number of correct student submissions to learn from, or suffer from lack of scalability and accuracy. In this work, we propose a fully automated approach for generating student program repairs in real-time. This is achieved by first re-factoring all available correct solutions to semantically equivalent solutions. Given an incorrect program, we match the program with the closest matching refactored program based on its control flow structure. Subsequently, we infer the input-output specifications of the incorrect program's basic blocks from the executions of the correct program's aligned basic blocks. Finally, these specifications are used to modify the blocks of the incorrect program via search-based synthesis. Our dataset consists of almost 1,800 real-life incorrect Python program submissions from 361 students for an introductory programming course at a large public university. Our experimental results suggest that our method is more effective and efficient than recently proposed feedback generation approaches. About 30% of the patches produced by our tool Refactory are smaller than those produced by the state-of-art tool Clara, and can be produced given fewer correct solutions (often a single correct solution) and in a shorter time. We opine that our method is applicable not only to programming assignments, and could be seen as a general-purpose program repair method that can achieve good results with just a single correct reference solution.", "author": [{"name": "Yang Hu", "affiliation": "The University of Texas at Austin"}, {"name": "Umair Z.

The event generation mechanism is defined by the execution monitor which uses CCI, providing flexibility for different monitors' execution models.

The paper deals with one possible means of approaching this problem by using the PVS theorem-prover. It describes a translation of a VDM-SL specification into the PVS specification language using, essentially, the very transparent translation methods described by Agerholm (1996). PVS was used to typecheck the specification and to prove some non-trivial validation conditions. Next, a more abstract specification of the same system was also expressed in PVS, and the original specification was shown to be a refinement of this one. The drawbacks of the translation are that it must be done manually (though automation may be possible), and that the \"shallow embedding\" technique which is used does not accurately capture the proof rules of VDM-SL. The benefits come from the facts that the portion of VDM-SL which can be represented is substantial and that it is a great advantage to be able to use the powerful PVS proof-checker.", "author": [{"name": "Savi Maharaj", "affiliation": "Department of Computing and Mathematics, Stirling University, Stirling, UK"}, {"name": "J.

Unlike comparable existing approaches for automatic debugging and maintenance tasks, InFix repairs input data rather than source code, does not require test cases, and does not require special annotations. Instead, we take advantage of patterns commonly used by novice programmers to automatically create helpful, high quality input repairs. InFix iteratively applies error-message based templates and random mutations based on insights about the debugging behavior of novices. This paper presents an implementation of InFix for Python. We evaluate on 29,995 unique scenarios with input-related errors collected from four years of data from Python Tutor, a free online programming tutoring environment. Our results generalize and scale; compared to previous work, we consider an order of magnitude more unique programs. Overall, InFix is able to repair 94.5% of deterministic input errors. We also present the results of a human study with 97 participants. Surprisingly, this simple approach produces high quality repairs; humans judged the output of InFix to be equally helpful and within 4% of the quality of human-generated repairs.", "author": [{"name": "Madeline Endres", "affiliation": "Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"}, {"name": "Georgios Sakkas", "affiliation": "Computer Science and Engineering UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Benjamin Cosman", "affiliation": "Computer Science and Engineering UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Ranjit Jhala", "affiliation": "Computer Science and Engineering UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Westley Weimer", "affiliation": "Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Compilation error repair: for the student programs from the student programs\"", "authors": ["U.

Understanding the effect of a patch is a key element of that trust. We find that differences in sets of formal invariants characterize patch differences and that implication-based distances in invariant space characterize patch similarities. When one patch is similar to another it often contains the same changes as well as additional behavior; this pattern is well-captured by logical implication. We can measure differences using a theorem prover to verify implications between invariants implied by separate programs. Although effective, theorem provers are computationally intensive; we find that string distance is an efficient heuristic for implication-based distance measurements. We propose to use distances between patches to construct a hierarchy highlighting patch similarities. We evaluated this approach on over 300 patches and found that it correctly categorizes programs into semantically similar clusters. Clustering programs reduces human effort by reducing the number of semantically distinct patches that must be considered by over 50%, thus reducing the time required to establish trust in automatically generated repairs.", "author": [{"name": "Padraic Cashin", "affiliation": "Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"}, {"name": "Carianne Martinez", "affiliation": "University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM"}, {"name": "Westley Weimer", "affiliation": "University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"}, {"name": "Stephanie Forrest", "affiliation": "Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"A descriptive model of computer code trustworthiness\"", "authors": ["G.

They are supported by all modern programming languages, and have been estimated to appear in more than a third of Python and JavaScript projects. Yet existing studies have focused mostly on one aspect of regex programming: readability. We know little about how developers perceive and program regexes, nor the difficulties that they face. In this paper, we provide the first study of the regex development cycle, with a focus on (1) how developers make decisions throughout the process, (2) what difficulties they face, and (3) how aware they are about serious risks involved in programming regexes. We took a mixed-methods approach, surveying 279 professional developers from a diversity of backgrounds (including top tech firms) for a high-level perspective, and interviewing 17 developers to learn the details about the difficulties that they face and the solutions that they prefer. In brief, regexes are hard. Not only are they hard to read, our participants said that they are hard to search for, hard to validate, and hard to document. They are also hard to master: the majority of our studied developers were unaware of critical security risks that can occur when using regexes, and those who knew of the risks did not deal with them in effective manners.

Empirical research has described characteristics like the distribution of regex feature usage, the structural complexity of regexes, and worst-case regex match behaviors. But researchers have not critically examined the methodology they follow to extract regexes, and findings to date are typically generalized from regexes written in only 1-2 programming languages. This is an incomplete foundation. Generalizing existing research depends on validating two hypotheses: (1) Various regex extraction methodologies yield similar results, and (2) Regex characteristics are similar across programming languages. To test these hypotheses, we defined eight regex metrics to capture the dimensions of regex representation, string language diversity, and worst-case match complexity. We report that the two competing regex extraction methodologies yield comparable corpuses, suggesting that simpler regex extraction techniques will still yield sound corpuses. But in comparing regexes across programming languages, we found significant differences in some characteristics by programming language. Our findings have bearing on future empirical methodology, as the programming language should be considered, and generalizability will not be assured.

Using this information, PSE can prioritize path exploration strategies. To calculate the probability of a path PSE relies on solution counting approaches for the path constraint. The correctness of a solution counting approach depends on the methodology used to count solutions and whether a path constraint maintains a one-to-one relation with program input values. This work focuses on the latter aspect of the solution counting correctness for string constraints. In general, maintaining a one-to-one relation is not always possible, especially in the presence of non-linear constraints. To deal with this issue, researchers that work on PSE for numerical domains either analyze programs with linear constraints, or develop novel techniques to handle solution counting of non-linear constraints. For the string domain, however, previous work on PSE mainly focuses on efficient and accurate solution counting for automata-based string models and has not investigated whether a one-to-one relationship between the strings encoded by automata and input string values is preserved. In this work we demonstrate that traditional automata-based string models fail to maintain one-to-one relations and propose to use the weighted automata model, which preserves the one-to-one relation between the path constraint it encodes and the input string values. We use this model to implement a string constraint solver and show its correctness on a set of non-trivial synthetic benchmarks. We also present an empirical evaluation of traditional and proposed automata solvers on real-world string constraints. The evaluations show that while being less efficient than traditional automata models, the weighted automata model maintains correct solution counts.", "author": [{"name": "Elena Sherman", "affiliation": "Computer Science Department, Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA"}, {"name": "Andrew Harris", "affiliation": "Computer Science Department, Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Symbolic execution and program testing\"", "authors": ["J.

We have developed an automated testing tool, called ADLscope, that utilizes the formal specification of a program unit as the basis for test coverage measurement. A tester uses ADLscope to test application programming interfaces (APIs) written in the C programming language. The API must be formally specified in the Assertion Definition Language (ADL). The tester uses ADLscope to generate coverage conditions from a program's ADL specifications. When the API is tested, ADLscope automatically measures how many of the coverage conditions have been covered by the tests.", "author": [{"name": "Juei Chang", "affiliation": "Information and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"}, {"name": "D.J.

This is particularly true when the fragment describes an intermediate protocol step, for example, because correctness is often stated in terms of all possible protocol outcomes. The paper illustrates this problem with a fragment describing a step in the CS-NC protocol used by the personal channel agent (PCA), the paper's primary case study. An example correctness property proved in the paper is Property V: given two properly initialized PCAs, CS-NC correctly transmits the new channel from one to the other, and an eavesdropper's action(s) will be detected by at least one of the PCAs, assuming (1) every protocol message sent is eventually received, and (2) only an eavesdropper can discover keys or channel identifiers (with significant probability).", "author": [{"name": "R.J.

Most quantitative program analysis techniques rely on model counting constraint solvers, which are typically the bottleneck for scalability. Although the effectiveness of formula caching in expediting expensive model-counting queries has been demonstrated in prior work, our key insight is that many subformulas are shared across non-identical constraints generated during program analyses. This has not been utilized by prior formula caching approaches. In this paper we present a subformula caching framework and integrate it into a model counting constraint solver. We experimentally evaluate its effectiveness under three quantitative program analysis scenarios: 1) model counting constraints generated by symbolic execution, 2) reliability analysis using probabilistic symbolic execution, 3) adaptive attack synthesis for side-channels. Our experimental results demonstrate that our subformula caching approach significantly improves the performance of quantitative program analysis.", "author": [{"name": "William Eiers", "affiliation": "UC Santa Barbara Verification Lab, Santa Barbara, CA"}, {"name": "Seemanta Saha", "affiliation": "UC Santa Barbara Verification Lab, Santa Barbara, CA"}, {"name": "Tegan Brennan", "affiliation": "UC Santa Barbara Verification Lab, Santa Barbara, CA"}, {"name": "Tevfik Bultan", "affiliation": "UC Santa Barbara Verification Lab, Santa Barbara, CA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Reusing constraint proofs in program analysis\"", "authors": ["Andrea Aquino", " Francesco A Bianchi", " Meixian Chen", " Giovanni Denaro ", " Mauro Pezz\u00e8"]}, {"title": " \"Heuristically matching solution spaces of arithmetic formulas to efficiently reuse solutions\"", "authors": ["Andrea Aquino", " Giovanni Denaro ", " Mauro Pezz\u00e8"]}, {"title": " \"Automata-based model counting for string constraints\"", "authors": ["Abdulbaki Aydin", " Lucas Bang ", " Tevfik Bultan"]}, {"title": " \"Parameterized model counting for string and numeric constraints\"", "authors": ["Abdulbaki Aydin", " William Eiers", " Lucas Bang", " Tegan Brennan", " Miroslav Gavrilov", " Tevfik Bultan", " ."]}, {"title": " \"Automatic discovery and quantification of information leaks\"", "authors": ["Michael Backes", " Boris K\u00f6pf ", " Andrey Rybalchenko"]}, {"title": " \"String analysis for side channels with segmented oracles\"", "authors": ["Lucas Bang", " Abdulbaki Aydin", " Quoc-Sang Phan", " Corina S.

However, configuration tuning requires a deep understanding of the software system, far beyond the abilities of typical system users. To address this issue, many existing approaches focus on exploring and learning good performance estimation models. The accuracy of such models often suffers when the number of available samples is small, a thorny challenge under a given tuning-time constraint. By contrast, we hypothesize that good configurations often share certain hidden structures. Therefore, instead of trying to improve the performance estimation of a given configuration, we focus on capturing the hidden structures of good configurations and utilizing such learned structure to generate potentially better configurations. We propose ACTGAN to achieve this goal. We have implemented and evaluated ACTGAN using 17 workloads with eight different software systems. Experimental results show that ACTGAN outperforms default configurations by 76.22% on average, and six state-of-the-art configuration tuning algorithms by 6.58%-64.56%. Furthermore, the ACTGAN-generated configurations are often better than those used in training and show certain features consisting with domain knowledge, both of which supports our hypothesis.", "author": [{"name": "Liang Bao", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, XiDian University, Xi\u2019an, ShaanXi, China"}, {"name": "Xin Liu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA"}, {"name": "Fangzheng Wang", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, XiDian University, Xi\u2019an, ShaanXi, China"}, {"name": "Baoyin Fang", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, XiDian University, Xi\u2019an, ShaanXi, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Starfish: A self-tuning system for big data analytics\"", "authors": ["H.

Our interest is in widely distributed workflow processes, i.e. systems that allow each instance of a process model to be enacted in a distributed fashion, with different parts of the process being enacted on different nodes of the system. More specifically, we are interested in the problem of dynamic workflow process evolution in such a distributed context, where the propagation of changes to all the concerned nodes has to be performed in an orderly manner. We address the problem of dynamic workflow process evolution from a coordination system approach, considering the workflow system as a coordination system and the workflow evolution as a coordinated evolution of the coordination schemes. We illustrate the problem of workflow evolution in a software engineering context, and describe a method using the reflexive features of our underlying coordination system to support dynamic workflow process evolution in a distributed workflow system.", "author": [{"name": "J.-M.

Most are not actively maintained, allowing for drift between the most recent possible configuration and the code snippet as the snippet becomes out-of-date over time. Recent work has identified the problem of validating and detecting out-of-date code snippets as the most important consideration for code reuse. However, determining if a snippet is correct, but simply out-of-date, is a non-trivial task. In the best case, breaking changes are well documented, allowing developers to manually determine when a code snippet contains an out-of-date API usage. In the worst case, determining if and when a breaking change was made requires an exhaustive search through previous dependency versions. We present V2, a strategy for determining if a code snippet is out-of-date by detecting discrete instances of configuration drift, where the snippet uses an API which has since undergone a breaking change. Each instance of configuration drift is classified by a failure encountered during validation and a configuration patch, consisting of dependency version changes, which fixes the underlying fault. V2 uses feedback-directed search to explore the possible configuration space for a code snippet, reducing the number of potential environment configurations that need to be validated. When run on a corpus of public Python snippets from prior research, V2 identifies 248 instances of configuration drift.", "author": [{"name": "Eric Horton", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Chris Parnin", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Blogging developer knowledge: Motivations challenges and future directions\"", "authors": ["C.

Exhaustively analyzing all the exponential number of possible configurations is prohibitively costly. Thus, various sampling techniques have been proposed to systematically narrow down the exponential number of legal configurations to be analyzed. Since analyzing all selected configurations can require a huge amount of effort, fault-based configuration prioritization, that helps detect faults earlier, can yield practical benefits in quality assurance. In this paper, we propose CoPro, a novel formulation of feature-interaction bugs via common program entities enabled/disabled by the features. Leveraging from that, we develop an efficient feature-interaction-aware configuration prioritization technique for a configurable system by ranking the configurations according to their total number of potential bugs. We conducted several experiments to evaluate CoPro on the ability to detect configuration-related bugs in a public benchmark. We found that CoPro outperforms the state-of-the-art configuration prioritization techniques when we add them on advanced sampling algorithms. In 78% of the cases, CoPro ranks the buggy configurations at the top 3 positions in the resulting list. Interestingly, CoPro is able to detect 17 not-yet-discovered feature-interaction bugs.", "author": [{"name": "Son Nguyen", "affiliation": "Computer Science Department, The University of Texas at Dallas, USA"}, {"name": "Hoan Nguyen", "affiliation": "Amazon Corporation, USA"}, {"name": "Ngoc Tran", "affiliation": "Computer Science Department, The University of Texas at Dallas, USA"}, {"name": "Hieu Tran", "affiliation": "Computer Science Department, The University of Texas at Dallas, USA"}, {"name": "Tien Nguyen", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"42 Variability Bugs in the Linux Kernel: A Qualitative Analysis\"", "authors": ["Iago Abal", " Claus Brabr", " "]}, {"title": " \"Similarity-based prioritization in software product-line testing\"", "authors": ["Mustafa Al-Hajjaji", " Thomas Th\u00fcm", " Jens Meinicke", " Malte Lochau ", " Gunter Saake"]}, {"title": " \"An overview of feature-oriented software development\"", "authors": ["Sven Apel ", " Christian K\u00e4stner"]}, {"title": " \"Exploring feature interactions in the wild: The new feature-interaction challenge\"", "authors": ["Sven Apel", " Sergiy Kolesnikov", " Norbert Siegmund", " Christian K\u00e4stner ", " Brady Garvin"]}, {"title": " \"Detection of Feature Interactions Using Feature-aware Verification\"", "authors": ["Sven Apel", " Hendrik Speidel", " Philipp Wendler", " Alex", "er von Rhein "]}, {"title": " \"Feature models grammars and propositional formulas\"", "authors": ["Don Batory"]}, {"title": " \"A study of variability models and languages in the systems software domain\"", "authors": ["T.

To find these inputs by hand is extremely time-consuming, especially when the software is complex. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to automate the process. Random test data generation consists of generating test inputs at random, in the hope that they will exercise the desired software features. Often, the desired inputs must satisfy complex constraints, and this makes a random approach seem unlikely to succeed. In contrast, combinatorial optimization techniques, such as those using genetic algorithms, are meant to solve difficult problems involving the simultaneous satisfaction of many constraints.

Among these techniques, two popular families are spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) and statistical debugging (SD), both localizing faults by collecting statistical information at runtime. Though the ideas are similar, the two families have been developed independently and their combinations have not been systematically explored. In this paper we perform a systematical empirical study on the combination of SBFL and SD. We first build a unified model of the two techniques, and systematically explore four types of variations, different predicates, different risk evaluation formulas, different granularities of data collection, and different methods of combining suspicious scores. Our study leads to several findings. First, most of the effectiveness of the combined approach contributed by a simple type of predicates: branch conditions. Second, the risk evaluation formulas of SBFL significantly outperform that of SD. Third, fine-grained data collection significantly outperforms coarse-grained data collection with a little extra execution overhead. Fourth, a linear combination of SBFL and SD predicates outperforms both individual approaches. According to our empirical study, we propose a new fault localization approach, PREDFL (Predicate-based Fault Localization), with the best configuration for each dimension under the unified model. Then, we explore its complementarity to existing techniques by integrating PREDFL with a state-of-the-art fault localization framework. The experimental results show that PREDFL can further improve the effectiveness of state-of-the-art fault localization techniques.

To address these problems, we present SCMiner, a practical online bug diagnosis tool to help developers understand how a system-level concurrency fault happens based on the logs collected by the default system audit tools. SCMiner achieves online bug diagnosis to obviate the need for offline bug reproduction. SCMiner does not require code instrumentation on the production system or rely on the assumption of the availability of multiple failing executions. Specifically, after the system call traces are collected, SCMiner uses data mining and statistical anomaly detection techniques to identify the failure-inducing system call sequences. It then maps each abnormal sequence to specific application functions. We have conducted an empirical study on 19 real-world benchmarks. The results show that SCMiner is both effective and efficient at localizing system-level concurrency faults.", "author": [{"name": "Tarannum Shaila Zaman", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky"}, {"name": "Xue Han", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky"}, {"name": "Tingting Yu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Interactive visualization of concurrents programs\"", "authors": ["R.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RepTrace, a framework that leverages the uniform interfaces of system call tracing for monitoring executed build commands in diverse build environments and identifies the root causes for unreproducible builds by analyzing the system call traces of the executed build commands. Specifically, from the collected system call traces, RepTrace performs causality analysis to build a dependency graph starting from an inconsistent build artifact (across two builds) via two types of dependencies: read/write dependencies among processes and parent/child process dependencies, and searches the graph to find the processes that result in the inconsistencies. To address the challenges of massive noisy dependencies and uncertain parent/child dependencies, RepTrace includes two novel techniques: (1) using differential analysis on multiple builds to reduce the search space of read/write dependencies, and (2) computing similarity of the runtime values to filter out noisy parent/child process dependencies. The evaluation results of RepTrace over a set of real-world software packages show that RepTrace effectively finds not only the root cause commands responsible for the unreproducible builds, but also the files to patch for addressing the unreproducible issues. Among its Top-10 identified commands and files, RepTrace achieves high accuracy rate of 90.00% and 90.56% in identifying the root causes, respectively.", "author": [{"name": "Zhilei Ren", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Ubiquitous Network and Service Software of Liaoning Province; School of Software, Dalian University of Technology"}, {"name": "Changlin Liu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer and Data Sciences, Case Western Reserve University"}, {"name": "Xusheng Xiao", "affiliation": "Department of Computer and Data Sciences, Case Western Reserve University"}, {"name": "He Jiang", "affiliation": "School of Software, Dalian University of Technology"}, {"name": "Tao Xie", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Nix as HPC package management system\"", "authors": ["B.

A legacy system that has evolved has usually been worked on by many different programmers and reflects the different programming styles as practised by those programmers. We address the re-engineering of a large system, the TAMPR automatic program transformation system, written in pure Lisp. TAMPR is an essential tool in ongoing research on potential applications of automated program transformation. The program implementing the TAMPR system is better designed and more consistently coded than most legacy systems. Why, then, is reverse engineering being attempted for this system, given that it suffers few of the problems of more traditionally implemented legacy systems? We are interested in studying the problem of abstraction in reverse engineering, and the TAMPR system, with its systematic design and coding, provides a good starting point for studying approaches to automated abstraction to an object-oriented form. In addition, while the system in its present form meets the current needs of its users, there are problems with providing widely available, efficient implementations of the system. The target language for this experiment in reverse engineering is Java. Java was chosen because of its widespread availability, claimed portability and its integration with components for the construction of graphical user interfaces. We use TAMPR transformations to reverse engineer the TAMPR program itself.", "author": [{"name": "T.J.

However, despite the deep analogy between tests and formal proofs, mutation analysis has seldom been considered in the context of deductive verification. We propose mutation proving, a technique for analyzing verification projects that use proof assistants. We implemented our technique for the Coq proof assistant in a tool dubbed mCoq. mCoq applies a set of mutation operators to Coq definitions of functions and datatypes, inspired by operators previously proposed for functional programming languages. mCoq then checks proofs of lemmas affected by operator application. To make our technique feasible in practice, we implemented several optimizations in mCoq such as parallel proof checking. We applied mCoq to several medium and large scale Coq projects, and recorded whether proofs passed or failed when applying different mutation operators. We then qualitatively analyzed the mutants, finding many instances of incomplete specifications. For our evaluation, we made several improvements to serialization of Coq files and even discovered a notable bug in Coq itself, all acknowledged by developers. We believe mCoq can be useful both to proof engineers for improving the quality of their verification projects and to researchers for evaluating proof engineering techniques.", "author": [{"name": "Ahmet Celik", "affiliation": "The University of Texas at Austin"}, {"name": "Karl Palmskog", "affiliation": "The University of Texas at Austin"}, {"name": "Marinela Parovic", "affiliation": "The University of Texas at Austin"}, {"name": "Emilio Jes\u00fas Gallego Arias", "affiliation": "MINES ParisTech"}, {"name": "Milos Gligoric", "affiliation": "The University of Texas at Austin"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Mutation testing advances: An analysis and survey\"", "authors": ["M.

However, such comprehensive verification of multitasking embedded software together with its underlying operating system is very costly and impractical. To reduce the verification cost while achieving the desired accuracy, we propose a variant of CEGAR, named OiL-CEGAR (OS-in-the-Loop Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement), where a composition of a formal OS model and an abstracted application program is used for comprehensive verification and is successively refined using the counterexamples generated from the composition model. The refinement process utilizes the scheduling information in the counterexample, which acts as a mini-OS to check the executability of the counterexample trace on the concrete program. Our experiments using a prototype implementation of OiL-CEGAR show that OiL-CEGAR greatly improves the accuracy and efficiency of property checking in this domain. It automatically removed all false alarms and accomplished property checking within an average of 476 seconds over a set of multitasking programs, whereas model checking using existing approaches over the same set of programs either showed an accuracy of under 11.1% or was unable to finish the verification due to timeout.", "author": [{"name": "Dongwoo Kim", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"}, {"name": "Yunja Choi", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"Behavioral consistency of c and verilog programs using bounded model checking\"", "authors": ["E.

Their extension to non-critical software is one of the notable forthcoming challenges. For example, C programmers regularly use inline assembly for low-level optimizations and system primitives. This usually results in rendering state-of-the-art formal analyzers developed for C ineffective. We thus propose TINA, the first automated, generic, verification-friendly and trustworthy lifting technique turning inline assembly into semantically equivalent C code amenable to verification, in order to take advantage of existing C analyzers.

API usage examples are very helpful in this regard. Over the years, many automated methods have been proposed to generate code examples by clustering and summarizing relevant code snippets extracted from a code corpus. These approaches simplify source code as method invocation sequences or feature vectors. Such simplifications only model partial aspects of the code and tend to yield inaccurate examples. We propose CodeKernel, a graph kernel based approach to the selection of API usage examples. Instead of approximating source code as method invocation sequences or feature vectors, CodeKernel represents source code as object usage graphs. Then, it clusters graphs by embedding them into a continuous space using a graph kernel. Finally, it outputs code examples by selecting a representative graph from each cluster using designed ranking metrics. Our empirical evaluation shows that CodeKernel selects more accurate code examples than the related work (MUSE and eXoaDocs). A user study involving 25 developers in a multinational company also confirms the usefulness of CodeKernel in selecting API usage examples.", "author": [{"name": "Xiaodong Gu", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"}, {"name": "Hongyu Zhang", "affiliation": "The University of Newcastle, Australia"}, {"name": "Sunghun Kim", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"Mining idioms from source code\"", "authors": ["M.

However, constructing concise and consistent method names is often challenging, especially for inexperienced developers. To this end, advanced machine learning techniques have been recently leveraged to recommend method names automatically for given method bodies/implementation. Recent large-scale evaluations also suggest that such approaches are accurate. However, little is known about where and why such approaches work or don't work. To figure out the state of the art as well as the rationale for the success/failure, in this paper we conduct an empirical study on the state-of-the-art approach code2vec. We assess code2vec on a new dataset with more realistic settings. Our evaluation results suggest that although switching to new dataset does not significantly influence the performance, more realistic settings do significantly reduce the performance of code2vec. Further analysis on the successfully recommended method names also reveals the following findings: 1) around half (48.3%) of the accepted recommendations are made on getter/setter methods; 2) a large portion (19.2%) of the successfully recommended method names could be copied from the given bodies. To further validate its usefulness, we ask developers to manually score the difficulty in naming methods they developed. Code2vec is then applied to such manually scored methods to evaluate how often it works in need. Our evaluation results suggest that code2vec rarely works when it is really needed. Finally, to intuitively reveal the state of the art and to investigate the possibility of designing simple and straightforward alternative approaches, we propose a heuristics based approach to recommending method names. Evaluation results on large-scale dataset suggest that this simple heuristics-based approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning based approach, improving precision and recall by 65.25% and 22.45%, respectively. The comparison suggests that machine learning based recommendation of method names may still have a long way to go.", "author": [{"name": "Lin Jiang", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Hui Liu", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "He Jiang", "affiliation": "School of Software Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Concise and consistent naming\"", "authors": ["F.

One of the challenges is that anticipating API usability barriers and real-world usage is difficult, due to a lack of automated approaches to mine usability data at scale. In this paper, we focus on one particular grievance that developers repeatedly express in online discussions about APIs: \"boilerplate code.\" We investigate what properties make code count as boilerplate, the reasons for boilerplate, and how programmers can reduce the need for it. We then present MARBLE, a novel approach to automatically mine boilerplate code candidates from API client code repositories. MARBLE adapts existing techniques, including an API usage mining algorithm, an AST comparison algorithm, and a graph partitioning algorithm. We evaluate MARBLE with 13 Java APIs, and show that our approach successfully identifies both already-known and new API-related boilerplate code instances.", "author": [{"name": "Daye Nam", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University, USA"}, {"name": "Amber Horvath", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University, USA"}, {"name": "Andrew Macvean", "affiliation": "Google, Inc., USA"}, {"name": "Brad Myers", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University, USA"}, {"name": "Bogdan Vasilescu", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University, USA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"How to design a good API and why it matters\"", "authors": ["J.

It transforms binaries into high-level code, reversing the compilation process. Decompilers can reconstruct much of the information that is lost during the compilation process (e.g., structure and type information). Unfortunately, they do not reconstruct semantically meaningful variable names, which are known to increase code understandability. We propose the Decompiled Identifier Renaming Engine (DIRE), a novel probabilistic technique for variable name recovery that uses both lexical and structural information recovered by the decompiler. We also present a technique for generating corpora suitable for training and evaluating models of decompiled code renaming, which we use to create a corpus of 164,632 unique x86-64 binaries generated from C projects mined from GitHub.

Exhaustive regression testing is usually impractical, because rigorous performance benchmarking requires executing a realistic workload per revision, which results in large execution times. In this paper, we propose a novel active revision sampling approach, which aims at tracking and understanding a system's performance history by approximating the performance behavior of a software system across all of its revisions. In a nutshell, we iteratively sample and measure the performance of specific revisions that help us building an exact performance-evolution model, and we use Gaussian Process models to assess in which revision ranges our model is most uncertain with the goal to sample further revisions for measurement. We have conducted an empirical analysis of the evolutionary performance behavior modeled as a time series of the histories of six real-world software systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that Gaussian Process models are able to accurately estimate the performance-evolution history of real-world software systems with only few measurements and to reveal interesting behaviors and trends.", "author": [{"name": "Stefan M\u00fchlbauer", "affiliation": "Bauhaus-University Weimar, Weimar, Germany"}, {"name": "Sven Apel", "affiliation": "Saarland University, Germany"}, {"name": "Norbert Siegmund", "affiliation": "Bauhaus-University Weimar, Germany"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Time is bandwidth?

To ease the development efforts, Object Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks provide an abstraction for developers to manage databases by writing in the same Object-Oriented programming languages. Prior studies have shown that there are various types of performance issues caused by inefficient accesses to databases via different ORM frameworks (e.g., Hibernate and ActiveRecord). However, it is not clear whether the reported performance anti-patterns (common performance issues) can be generalizable across various frameworks. In particular, there is no study focusing on detecting performance issues for applications written in PHP, which is the choice of programming languages for the majority (79%) of web applications. In this experience paper, we detail our process on conducting performance-aware refactoring of an industrial web application written in Laravel, the most popular web framework in PHP. We have derived a complete catalog of 17 performance anti-patterns based on prior research and our experimentation. We have found that some of the reported anti-patterns and refactoring techniques are framework or programming language specific, whereas others are general. The performance impact of the anti-pattern instances are highly dependent on the actual usage context (workload and database settings). When communicating the performance differences before and after refactoring, the results of the complex statistical analysis may be sometimes confusing. Instead, developers usually prefer more intuitive measures like percentage improvement. Experiments show that our refactoring techniques can reduce the response time up to 93.0% and 93.4% for the industrial and the open source application under various scenarios.", "author": [{"name": "Boyuan Chen", "affiliation": "York University, Toronto, Canada"}, {"name": "Zhen Ming Jiang", "affiliation": "York University, Toronto, ON, Canada"}, {"name": "Paul Matos", "affiliation": "Copywell Inc., Toronto, Canada"}, {"name": "Michael Lacaria", "affiliation": "Copywell Inc., Toronto, Canada"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "1", "references": [{"title": " \"Detecting performance anti-patterns for applications developed using object-relational mapping\"", "authors": ["T.-H.

We observed that developers sometimes use alternative data analytics APIs to improve program runtime performance while preserving functional equivalence. However, little is known on the characteristics and performance attributes of alternative data analytics APIs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extracting alternative implementations that invoke different data analytics APIs to solve the same tasks. A key appeal of our approach is that it exploits the comparative structures in Stack Overflow discussions to discover programming alternatives. We show that our approach is promising, as 86% of the extracted code pairs were validated as true alternative implementations. In over 20% of these pairs, the faster implementation was reported to achieve a 10x or more speedup over its slower alternative.

Practitioners may capture user behaviour at different levels of granularity. A coarse-grained load test may miss detailed user behaviour, leading to a non-representative load test; while an extremely fine-grained load test would simply replay user actions step by step, leading to load tests that are costly to develop, execute and maintain. Workload recovery is at core of these load tests. Prior research often captures the workload as the frequency of user actions. However, there exists much valuable information in the context and sequences of user actions. Such richer information would ensure that the load tests that leverage such workloads are more field-representative. In this experience paper, we study the use of different granularities of user behaviour, i.e., basic user actions, basic user actions with contextual information and user action sequences with contextual information, when recovering workloads for use in the load testing of large-scale systems. We propose three approaches that are based on the three granularities of user behaviour and evaluate our approaches on four subject systems, namely Apache James, OpenMRS, Google Borg, and an ultra-large-scale industrial system (SA) from Alibaba. Our results show that our approach that is based on user action sequences with contextual information outperforms the other two approaches and can generate more representative load tests with similar throughput and CPU usage to the original field workload (i.e., mostly statistically insignificant or with small/trivial effect sizes). Such representative load tests are generated only based on a small number of clusters of users, leading to a low cost of conducting/maintaining such tests. Finally, we demonstrate that our approaches can detect injected users in the original field workloads with high precision and recall. Our paper demonstrates the importance of user action sequences with contextual information in the workload recovery of large-scale systems.", "author": [{"name": "Jinfu Chen", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University, Montre\u00e1, Canada"}, {"name": "Weiyi Shang", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University, Montre\u00e1, Canada"}, {"name": "Ahmed E.

The previous researches mainly focus on the quality problems of class imbalance and feature redundancy. However, training data often contains some instances that belong to different class but have similar values on features, and this leads to class overlap to affect the quality of training data. Our goal is to investigate the impact of class overlap on software defect prediction. At the same time, we propose an improved K-Means clustering cleaning approach (IKMCCA) to solve both the class overlap and class imbalance problems. Specifically, we check whether K-Means clustering cleaning approach (KMCCA) or neighborhood cleaning learning (NCL) or IKMCCA is feasible to improve defect detection performance for two cases (i) within-project defect prediction (WPDP) (ii) cross-project defect prediction (CPDP). To have an objective estimate of class overlap, we carry out our investigations on 28 open source projects, and compare the performance of state-of-the-art learning models for the above-mentioned cases by using IKMCCA or KMCCA or NCL VS. without cleaning data. The experimental results make clear that learning models obtain significantly better performance in terms of balance, Recall and AUC for both WPDP and CPDP when the overlapping instances are removed. Moreover, it is better to consider both class overlap and class imbalance.", "author": [{"name": "Lina Gong", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"}, {"name": "Shujuan Jiang", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"}, {"name": "Rongcun Wang", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"}, {"name": "Li Jiang", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "2", "references": [{"title": " \"Learning from open-source projects: An empirical study on defect prediction\"", "authors": ["H.

A program contains instructions expressed via code statements, which are considered as the basic units of program execution. In this paper, we introduce AutoSC, which combines program analysis and the principle of software naturalness to fill in a partially completed statement. AutoSC benefits from the strengths of both directions, in which the completed code statement is both frequent and valid. AutoSC is first trained on a large code corpus to derive the templates of candidate statements. Then, it uses program analysis to validate and concretize the templates into syntactically and type-valid candidate statements. Finally, these candidates are ranked by using a language model trained on the lexical form of the source code in the code corpus. Our empirical evaluation on the large datasets of real-world projects shows that AutoSC achieves 38.9-41.3% top-1 accuracy and 48.2-50.1% top-5 accuracy in statement completion.

Code coverage criteria can be used to quantify the richness of a test suite (e.g., whether a program has been tested sufficiently) or provide practical guidelines on test case generation (e.g., as objective functions used in program fuzzing engines). Traditional code coverage criteria are, however, designed for sequential programs and thus ineffective for concurrent programs. In this work, we introduce a novel code coverage criterion for testing thread-safe classes called MAP-coverage (short for memory-access patterns). The motivation is that concurrency bugs are often correlated with certain memory-access patterns, and thus it is desirable to comprehensively cover all memory-access patterns. Furthermore, we propose a testing method for maximizing MAP-coverage. Our method has been implemented as a self-contained toolkit, and the experimental results on 20 benchmark programs show that our toolkit outperforms existing testing methods. Lastly, we show empirically that there exists positive correlation between MAP-coverage and the effectiveness of a set of test executions.", "author": [{"name": "Zan Wang", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"}, {"name": "Yingquan Zhao", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"}, {"name": "Shuang Liu", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"}, {"name": "Jun Sun", "affiliation": "School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University"}, {"name": "Xiang Chen", "affiliation": "School of Information Science and Technology, Nantong University, China"}, {"name": "Huarui Lin", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Fundamental statistics in psychology and education\"", "authors": ["J B.

In this paper, we propose AuCS, the first general framework to automate synchronization for CUDA kernel functions. AuCS transforms the original LLVM-level CUDA program control flow graph in a semantic-preserving manner for exploring the possible barrier function locations. Accordingly, AuCS develops mechanisms to correctly place barrier functions for automating synchronization in multiple erroneous (challenging-to-be-detected) synchronization scenarios, including data race, barrier divergence, and redundant barrier functions. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of AuCS, we conduct an extensive set of experiments and the results demonstrate that AuCS can automate 20 out of 24 erroneous synchronization scenarios.", "author": [{"name": "Mingyuan Wu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"}, {"name": "Lingming Zhang", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, USA"}, {"name": "Cong Liu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, USA"}, {"name": "Shin Hwei Tan", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"}, {"name": "Yuqun Zhang", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Curd: A dynamic cuda race detector\"", "authors": ["Y.

Our insight is that there are usually few to no atomicity violations among transactions reported during a program execution. We present TPLAY, a novel deterministic replay technique which records thread access interleavings on shared memory locations at the transactional level. TPLAY also generates an artificial pair of interleavings when an atomicity violation is reported on a transaction. We present an experiment using the Splash2x extension of the PARSEC benchmark suite.

Even until recently, automated game testing still remains to be largely untouched niche. A key challenge is that game testing often requires to play the game as a sequential decision process. A bug may only be triggered until completing certain difficult intermediate tasks, which requires a certain level of intelligence. The recent success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) sheds light on advancing automated game testing, without human competitive intelligent support. However, the existing DRLs mostly focus on winning the game rather than game testing. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we first perform an in-depth analysis of 1349 real bugs from four real-world commercial game products. Based on this, we propose four oracles to support automated game testing, and further propose Wuji, an on-the-fly game testing framework, which leverages evolutionary algorithms, DRL and multi-objective optimization to perform automatic game testing. Wuji balances between winning the game and exploring the space of the game. Winning the game allows the agent to make progress in the game, while space exploration increases the possibility of discovering bugs. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on a simple game and two popular commercial games. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Wuji in exploring space and detecting bugs. Moreover, Wuji found 3 previously unknown bugs, which have been confirmed by the developers, in the commercial games.", "author": [{"name": "Yan Zheng", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"}, {"name": "Xiaofei Xie", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"}, {"name": "Ting Su", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"}, {"name": "Lei Ma", "affiliation": "Kyushu University, Japan"}, {"name": "Jianye Hao", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"}, {"name": "Zhaopeng Meng", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"}, {"name": "Yang Liu", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"}, {"name": "Ruimin Shen", "affiliation": "Fuxi AI Lab, Netease, Inc., Hangzhou, China"}, {"name": "Yingfeng Chen", "affiliation": "Fuxi AI Lab, Netease, Inc., Hangzhou, China"}, {"name": "Changjie Fan", "affiliation": "Fuxi AI Lab, Netease, Inc., Hangzhou, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "5", "references": [{"title": " \"Reinforcement learning for android GUI testing\"", "authors": ["David Adamo", " Sreedevi Koppula ", " Ren\u00e9e C.

Different from testing general software, for which output is often asserted definitely (e.g., an output is compared with an oracle for equality), testing deep learning libraries often requires to perform oracle approximations, i.e., the output is allowed to be within a restricted range of the oracle. However, oracle approximation practices have not been studied in prior empirical work that focuses on traditional testing practices. The prevalence, common practices, maintenance and evolution challenges of oracle approximations remain unknown in literature. In this work, we study oracle approximation assertions implemented to test four popular DL libraries. Our study shows that there exists a non-negligible portion of assertions that leverage oracle approximation in the test cases of DL libraries. Also, we identify the common sources of oracles on which oracle approximations are being performed through a comprehensive manual study. Moreover, we find that developers frequently modify code related to oracle approximations, i.e., using a different approximation API, modifying the oracle or the output from the code under test, and using a different approximation threshold. Last, we performed an in-depth study to understand the reasons behind the evolution of oracle approximation assertions. Our findings reveal important maintenance challenges that developers may face when maintaining oracle approximation practices as code evolves in DL libraries.", "author": [{"name": "Mahdi Nejadgholi", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University"}, {"name": "Jinqiu Yang", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": "\"Theano: A Python framework for fast computation of mathematical expressions\"", "authors": []}, {"title": " \"Cradle: Cross-backend validation to detect and localize bugs in deep learning libraries\"", "authors": ["H.

A variety of DL frameworks and platforms play a key role to catalyze such progress. However, the differences in architecture designs and implementations of existing frameworks and platforms bring new challenges for DL software development and deployment. Till now, there is no study on how various mainstream frameworks and platforms influence both DL software development and deployment in practice. To fill this gap, we take the first step towards understanding how the most widely-used DL frameworks and platforms support the DL software development and deployment. We conduct a systematic study on these frameworks and platforms by using two types of DNN architectures and three popular datasets. (1) For development process, we investigate the prediction accuracy under the same runtime training configuration or same model weights/biases. We also study the adversarial robustness of trained models by leveraging the existing adversarial attack techniques. The experimental results show that the computing differences across frameworks could result in an obvious prediction accuracy decline, which should draw the attention of DL developers. (2) For deployment process, we investigate the prediction accuracy and performance (refers to time cost and memory consumption) when the trained models are migrated/quantized from PC to real mobile devices and web browsers. The DL platform study unveils that the migration and quantization still suffer from compatibility and reliability issues. Meanwhile, we find several DL software bugs by using the results as a benchmark. We further validate the results through bug confirmation from stakeholders and industrial positive feedback to highlight the implications of our study. Through our study, we summarize practical guidelines, identify challenges and pinpoint new research directions, such as understanding the characteristics of DL frameworks and platforms, avoiding compatibility and reliability issues, detecting DL software bugs, and reducing time cost and memory consumption towards developing and deploying high quality DL systems effectively.", "author": [{"name": "Qianyu Guo", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"}, {"name": "Sen Chen", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"}, {"name": "Xiaofei Xie", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"}, {"name": "Lei Ma", "affiliation": "Kyushu University, Japan"}, {"name": "Qiang Hu", "affiliation": "Kyushu University, Japan"}, {"name": "Hongtao Liu", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"}, {"name": "Yang Liu", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"}, {"name": "Jianjun Zhao", "affiliation": "Kyushu University, Japan"}, {"name": "Xiaohong Li", "affiliation": "College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": "3", "references": [{"title": " \"Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning\"", "authors": ["M.

Several recent empirical studies show that developers, in practice, are applying refactoring incrementally when they are fixing bugs or adding new features. There is an urgent need for refactoring tools that can support continuous integration and some recent development processes such as DevOps that are based on rapid releases. Furthermore, several studies show that manual refactoring is expensive and existing automated refactoring tools are challenging to configure and integrate into the development pipelines with significant disruption cost. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, an intelligent software refactoring bot, called RefBot. Integrated into the version control system (e.g. GitHub), our bot continuously monitors the software repository, and it is triggered by any \"open\" or \"merge\" action on pull requests. The bot analyzes the files changed during that pull request to identify refactoring opportunities using a set of quality attributes then it will find the best sequence of refactorings to fix the quality issues if any. The bot recommends all these refactorings through an automatically generated pull-request. The developer can review the recommendations and their impacts in a detailed report and select the code changes that he wants to keep or ignore. After this review, the developer can close and approve the merge of the bot's pull request. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the performance and effectiveness of RefBot by a survey conducted with experienced developers who used the bot on both open source and industry projects.", "author": [{"name": "Vahid Alizadeh", "affiliation": "Software Engineering Intelligence Lab, University of Michigan, USA"}, {"name": "Mohamed Amine Ouali", "affiliation": "Software Engineering Intelligence Lab, University of Michigan, USA"}, {"name": "Marouane Kessentini", "affiliation": "Software Engineering Intelligence Lab, University of Michigan, USA"}, {"name": "Meriem Chater", "affiliation": "Software Engineering Intelligence Lab, University of Michigan, USA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Software change impact analysis\"", "authors": ["S.

Asynchronous applications - which are notoriously error-prone to implement and to maintain - greatly benefit from reactive programming because they can be defined in a declarative style, which improves code clarity and extensibility. In this paper, we tackle the problem of refactoring existing software that has been designed with traditional abstractions for asynchronous programming. We propose 2Rx, a refactoring approach to automatically convert asynchronous code to reactive programming. Our evaluation on top-starred GitHub projects shows that 2Rx is effective with the most common asynchronous constructs, covering 12.7% of projects with asynchronous computations, and it can provide a refactoring for 91.7% of their occurrences.", "author": [{"name": "Mirko K\u00f6hler", "affiliation": "Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"}, {"name": "Guido Salvaneschi", "affiliation": "Reactive Programming Technology Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Refactoring for asynchronous execution on mobile devices\"", "authors": ["D Dig"]}, {"title": " \"The java.util.concurrent synchronizer framework\"", "authors": ["D Lea"]}, {"title": " \"A survey on reactive programming\"", "authors": ["E Bainomugisha", " A.

As modern software systems are evolving into large scale and complex structures, logs have become one type of fast-growing big data in industry. In particular, such logs often need to be stored for a long time in practice (e.g., a year), in order to analyze recurrent problems or track security issues. However, archiving logs consumes a large amount of storage space and computing resources, which in turn incurs high operational cost. Data compression is essential to reduce the cost of log storage. Traditional compression tools (e.g., gzip) work well for general texts, but are not tailed for system logs. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective log compression method, namely logzip. Logzip is capable of extracting hidden structures from raw logs via fast iterative clustering and further generating coherent intermediate representations that allow for more effective compression. We evaluate logzip on five large log datasets of different system types, with a total of 63.6 GB in size. The results show that logzip can save about half of the storage space on average over traditional compression tools. Meanwhile, the design of logzip is highly parallel and only incurs negligible overhead. In addition, we share our industrial experience of applying logzip to Huawei's real products.", "author": [{"name": "Jinyang Liu", "affiliation": "Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"}, {"name": "Jieming Zhu", "affiliation": "Huawei Noah\u2019s Ark Lab, Shenzhen, China"}, {"name": "Shilin He", "affiliation": "The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"}, {"name": "Pinjia He", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich, Switzerland"}, {"name": "Zibin Zheng", "affiliation": "Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"}, {"name": "Michael R.

Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) regards those models as representable entities that are amenable to automated analysis and processing, facilitating quality assurance while increasing productivity in software development processes. Although this connection is not new, very few approaches facilitate adoption of MDE tooling without compromising existing value, their data. Moreover, switching to MDE tooling usually involves re-engineering core parts of an application, hindering backward compatibility and, thereby, continuous integration, while requiring an up-front investment in training in specialized modeling frameworks. In those approaches that overcome the previous problem, there is no clear indication - from a quantitative point of view - of the extent to which adopting state-of-the-art MDE practices and tooling is feasible or advantageous. In this work, we advocate a code-first approach to modeling through an approach for applying MDE techniques and tools to existing object-oriented software applications that fully preserves the semantics of the original application, which need not be modified. Our approach consists both of a semi-automated method for specifying explicit view models out of existing object-oriented applications and of a conservative extension mechanism that enables the use of such view models at run time, where view model queries are resolved on demand and view model updates are propagated incrementally to the original application. This mechanism enables an iterative, flexible application of MDE tooling to software applications, where metamodels and models do not exist explicitly. An evaluation of this extension mechanism, implemented for Java applications and for view models atop the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), has been conducted with an industry-targeted benchmark for decision support systems, analyzing performance and scalability of the synchronization mechanism.

Current approaches to mitigating compression side channels have drawbacks in that they either degrade compression ratio drastically or require too much effort from developers to be widely adopted. To bridge the gap, we develop Debreach, a static analysis and program transformation based approach to mitigating compression side channels. Debreach consists of two steps. First, it uses taint analysis to soundly identify flows of sensitive data in the program and uses code instrumentation to annotate data before feeding them to the compressor. Second, it enhances the compressor to exploit the freedom to not compress of standard compression protocols, thus removing the dependency between sensitive data and the size of the compressor's output. Since Debreach automatically instruments applications and does not change the compression protocols, it has the advantage of being non-disruptive and compatible with existing systems. We have evaluated Debreach on a set of web server applications written in PHP. Our experiments show that, while ensuring leakage-freedom, Debreach can achieve significantly higher compression performance than state-of-the-art approaches.", "author": [{"name": "Brandon Paulsen", "affiliation": "University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Chungha Sung", "affiliation": "University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Peter A.H.

One of its biggest challenges is the state space explosion problem: DSE tries to evaluate all possible execution paths of an application. For every path, it needs to represent the allocated memory and its accesses. Even though different approaches have been proposed to mitigate the state space explosion problem, DSE still needs to represent a multitude of states in parallel to analyse them. If too many states are present, they cannot fit into memory, and DSE needs to terminate them prematurely or store them on disc intermediately. With a more efficient representation of allocated memory, DSE can handle more states simultaneously, improving its performance. In this work, we introduce an enhanced, fine-grain and efficient representation of memory that mimics the allocations of tested applications. We tested Coreutils using three different search strategies with our implementation on top of the symbolic execution engine KLEE. We achieve a significant reduction of the memory consumption of states by up to 99.06% (mean DFS: 2%, BFS: 51%, Cov.: 49%), allowing to represent more states in memory more efficiently. The total execution time is reduced by up to 97.81% (mean DFS: 9%, BFS: 7%, Cov.:4%)-a speedup of 49x in comparison to baseline KLEE.", "author": [{"name": "Martin Nowack", "affiliation": "Department of Computing, Imperial College, London"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"EXE: Automatically Generating Inputs of Death\"", "authors": ["C Cadar", " V Ganesh", " P.

Each of these techniques, however, face inherent challenges, such as insufficient capability when handling memory aliases. Recent works have used hypothesis testing to address this drawback, albeit with high computational complexity, making them impractical for real world applications. To address this issue, we propose a new deep neural architecture, which could significantly improve memory alias resolution. At the high level, our approach employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn the binary code pattern pertaining to memory accesses. It then infers the memory region accessed by memory references. Since memory references to different regions naturally indicate a non-alias relationship, our neural architecture can greatly reduce the burden of doing hypothesis testing to track down non-alias relation in binary code. Different from previous researches that have utilized deep learning for other binary analysis tasks, the neural network proposed in this work is fundamentally novel. Instead of simply using off-the-shelf neural networks, we designed a new recurrent neural architecture that could capture the data dependency between machine code segments. To demonstrate the utility of our deep neural architecture, we implement it as RENN, a neural network-assisted reverse execution system. We utilize this tool to analyze software crashes corresponding to 40 memory corruption vulnerabilities from the real world. Our experiments show that RENN can significantly improve the efficiency of locating the root cause for the crashes. Compared to a state-of-the-art technique, RENN has 36.25% faster execution time on average, detects an average of 21.35% more non-alias pairs, and successfully identified the root cause of 12.5% more cases.", "author": [{"name": "Dongliang Mu", "affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China"}, {"name": "Wenbo Guo", "affiliation": "College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, USA"}, {"name": "Alejandro Cuevas", "affiliation": "College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, USA"}, {"name": "Yueqi Chen", "affiliation": "College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, USA"}, {"name": "Jinxuan Gai", "affiliation": "College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, USA"}, {"name": "Xinyu Xing", "affiliation": "College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, USA"}, {"name": "Bing Mao", "affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China"}, {"name": "Chengyu Song", "affiliation": "University of California, Riverside, USA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Retracer: Triaging crashes by reverse execution from partial memory dumps\u201d\"", "authors": ["W.

To meet this requirement efficiently, there have been many works on demand-driven analyses that perform only the work necessary to compute the points-to or alias information on the requested variables (queries). However, these demand-driven analyses can be very expensive when applied on large systems where the number of queries can be significant. Such a blow-up in analysis time is unacceptable in cases where scalability with real-time constraints is crucial; for example, when program analysis tools are plugged into an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). In this paper, we propose schemes to improve the scalability of demand-driven analyses without compromising on precision. Our work is based on novel ideas for eliminating irrelevant and redundant data-flow paths for the given queries. We introduce the idea of batch analysis, which can answer multiple given queries in batch mode. Batch analysis suits the environments with strict time constraints, where the queries come in batch. We present a batch alias analysis framework that can be used to speed up given demand-driven alias analysis. To show the effectiveness of this framework, we use two demand-driven alias analyses (1) the existing best performing demand-driven alias analysis tool for race-detection clients and (2) an optimized version thereof that avoids irrelevant computation. Our evaluations on a simulated data-race client, and on a recent program-understanding tool, show that batch analysis leads to significant performance gains, along with minor gains in precision.", "author": [{"name": "Jyothi Vedurada", "affiliation": "Dept. of CSE, IIT Madras"}, {"name": "V.

For example, a self-adaptive cloud-basedsystem may have a tactic that initiates additional computingresources when response time thresholds are surpassed, or theremay be a tactic to activate a specific security measure when anintrusion is detected. In real-world environments, these tacticsfrequently experiencetactic volatilitywhich is variable behaviorduring the execution of the tactic.Unfortunately, current self-adaptive approaches do not accountfor tactic volatility in their decision-making processes, and merelyassume that tactics do not experience volatility. This limitationcreates uncertainty in the decision-making process and mayadversely impact the system's ability to effectively and efficientlyadapt. Additionally, many processes do not properly account forvolatility that may effect the system's Service Level Agreement(SLA). This can limit the system's ability to act proactively, especially when utilizing tactics that contain latency.To address the challenge of sufficiently accounting for tacticvolatility, we propose aTactic Volatility Aware(TVA) solution.Using Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA), TVA enables self-adaptive systems to accurately estimate the cost and timerequired to execute tactics.

Assessing their effectiveness is challenging, however, as realistic sets of attacks to test them against are not always available. In this paper, we propose smart fuzzing, an automated, machine learning guided technique for systematically finding 'test suites' of CPS network attacks, without requiring any knowledge of the system's control programs or physical processes. Our approach uses predictive machine learning models and metaheuristic search algorithms to guide the fuzzing of actuators so as to drive the CPS into different unsafe physical states. We demonstrate the efficacy of smart fuzzing by implementing it for two real-world CPS testbeds-a water purification plant and a water distribution system-finding attacks that drive them into 27 different unsafe states involving water flow, pressure, and tank levels, including six that were not covered by an established attack benchmark. Finally, we use our approach to test the effectiveness of an invariant-based defence system for the water treatment plant, finding two attacks that were not detected by its physical invariant checks, highlighting a potential weakness that could be exploited in certain conditions.", "author": [{"name": "Yuqi Chen", "affiliation": "Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"}, {"name": "Christopher M.

These components are designed to satisfy their individual requirements, rather than the global requirements of the systems-of-systems.

In this paper, we propose a \"cautious\" adaptation approach which supports changing the behaviour of such defiant components under exceptional conditions to satisfy global requirements, while continuing to guarantee the satisfaction of the components' individual requirements. The approach represents both normal and exceptional conditions as scenarios; models the behaviour of exceptional conditions as wrappers implemented using an aspect-oriented technique; and deals with both single and multiple instances of defiant components with different precedence order at runtime. We evaluated an implementation of the approach using drones and boats for an organ delivery application conceived by our industrial partners, in which we assess how the proposed approach help achieve the system-of-systems' global requirements while accommodating increased complexity of hybrid aspects such as multiplicity, precedence ordering, openness and heterogeneity.", "author": [{"name": "Paulo Henrique Maia", "affiliation": "State University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil"}, {"name": "Lucas Vieira", "affiliation": "State University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil"}, {"name": "Matheus Chagas", "affiliation": "State University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil"}, {"name": "Yijun Yu", "affiliation": "Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom"}, {"name": "Andrea Zisman", "affiliation": "Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom"}, {"name": "Bashar Nuseibeh", "affiliation": "Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Awareness requirements for adaptive systems\"", "authors": ["V.

Severe software degradation does not happen overnight. Software evolves continuously, through numerous issues, fixing bugs and adding new features, and architecture flaws emerge quietly and largely unnoticed until they grow in scope and significance when the system becomes difficult to maintain. Developers are largely unaware of these flaws or the accumulating debt as they are focused on their immediate tasks of address individual issues. As a consequence, the cumulative impacts of their activities, as they affect the architecture, go unnoticed. To detect these problems early and prevent them from accumulating into severe ones we propose to monitor software evolution by tracking the interactions among files revised to address issues. In particular, we propose and show how we can automatically detect active hotspots, to reveal architecture problems. We have studied hundreds of hotspots along the evolution timelines of 21 open source projects and showed that there exist just a few dominating active hotspots per project at any given time. Moreover, these dominating active hotspots persist over long time periods, and thus deserve special attention. Compared with state-of-the-art design and code smell detection tools we report that, using active hotspots, it is possible to detect signs of software degradation both earlier and more precisely.", "author": [{"name": "Qiong Feng", "affiliation": "Drexel University Philadelphia, PA"}, {"name": "Yuanfang Cai", "affiliation": "Drexel University Philadelphia, PA"}, {"name": "Rick Kazman", "affiliation": "University of Hawaii & SEI/CMU, Honolulu, HI"}, {"name": "Di Cui", "affiliation": "Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University Xi\u2019an, China cuidi"}, {"name": "Ting Liu", "affiliation": "Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University Xi\u2019an, China cuidi"}, {"name": "Hongzhou Fang", "affiliation": "Drexel University Philadelphia, PA"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"A cost-benefit framework for making architectural decisions in a business context\"", "authors": ["J.

Such systems incorporate a number of smart software functions (SSFs) which gradually learn and adapt to the users' preferences. A key property of SSFs is their ability to learn based on data resulting from the interaction with the user (implicit and explicit feedback)-which we call trainability. Newly developed and enhanced features in a SSF must be evaluated based on their effect on the trainability of the system. Despite recent approaches for continuous deployment of machine learning systems, trainability evaluation is not yet part of continuous integration and deployment (CID) pipelines. In this paper, we describe the different facets of trainability for the development of SSFs. We also present our approach for automated trainability evaluation within an automotive CID framework which proposes to use automated quality gates for the continuous evaluation of machine learning models. The results from our indicative evaluation based on real data from eight BMW cars highlight the importance of continuous and rigorous trainability evaluation in the development of SSFs.", "author": [{"name": "Ilias Gerostathopoulos", "affiliation": "Department of Informatics, Technical University of Munich, Garching b.

Semistructured merge tools go further by partially exploring the syntactic structure of code artifacts, and, as a consequence, obtaining significant merge accuracy gains for Java-like languages. To understand whether semistructured merge and the observed gains generalize to other kinds of languages, we implement two semistructured merge tools for JavaScript, and compare them to an unstructured tool. We find that current semistructured merge algorithms and frameworks are not directly applicable for scripting languages like JavaScript. By adapting the algorithms, and studying 10,345 merge scenarios from 50 JavaScript projects on GitHub, we find evidence that our JavaScript tools report fewer spurious conflicts than unstructured merge, without compromising the correctness of the merging process.

These tools target clone detection in software applications written in a single programming language. However, a software application may be written in different languages for different platforms to improve the application's platform compatibility and adoption by users of different platforms. Cross language clones (CLCs) introduce additional challenges when maintaining multi-platform applications and would likely go undetected using existing tools. In this paper, we propose CLCDSA, a cross language clone detector which can detect CLCs without extensive processing of the source code and without the need to generate an intermediate representation. The proposed CLCDSA model analyzes different syntactic features of source code across different programming languages to detect CLCs. To support large scale clone detection, the CLCDSA model uses an action filter based on cross language API call similarity to discard non-potential clones. The design methodology of CLCDSA is two-fold: (a) it detects CLCs on the fly by comparing the similarity of features, and (b) it uses a deep neural network based feature vector learning model to learn the features and detect CLCs. Early evaluation of the model observed an average precision, recall and F-measure score of 0.55, 0.86, and 0.64 respectively for the first phase and 0.61, 0.93, and 0.71 respectively for the second phase which indicates that CLCDSA outperforms all available models in detecting cross language clones.", "author": [{"name": "Kawser Wazed Nafi", "affiliation": "Schneider Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada"}, {"name": "Tonny Shekha Kar", "affiliation": "Schneider Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada"}, {"name": "Banani Roy", "affiliation": "Schneider Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada"}, {"name": "Chanchal K.

{"doi": "10.1109/ASE.2019.00100", "title": "B2SFinder: Detecting Open-Source Software Reuse in COTS Software", "publisher": "2019 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)", "keyword": ["Open source software", "Libraries", "Software algorithms", "Security", "Switches", "Arrays"], "abstract": "COTS software products are developed extensively on top of OSS projects, resulting in OSS reuse vulnerabilities. To detect such vulnerabilities, finding OSS reuses in COTS software has become imperative. While scalable to tens of thousands of OSS projects, existing binary-to-source matching approaches are severely imprecise in analyzing COTS software products, since they support only a limited number of code features, compute matching scores only approximately in measuring OSS reuses, and neglect the code structures in OSS projects. We introduce a novel binary-to-source matching approach, called B2SFINDER\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n, to address these limitations. First of all, B2SFINDER can reason about seven kinds of code features that are traceable in both binary and source code. In order to compute matching scores precisely, B2SFINDER employs a weighted feature matching algorithm that combines three matching methods (for dealing with different code features) with two importance-weighting methods (for computing the weight of an instance of a code feature in a given COTS software application based on its specificity and occurrence frequency). Finally, B2SFINDER identifies different types of code reuses based on matching scores and code structures of OSS projects. We have implemented B2SFINDER using an optimized data structure. We have evaluated B2SFINDER using 21991 binaries from 1000 popular COTS software products and 2189 candidate OSS projects. Our experimental results show that B2SFINDER is not only precise but also scalable. Compared with the state ofthe art, B2SFINDER has successfully found up to 2.15\u00d7 as many reuse cases in 53.85 seconds per binary file on average. We also discuss how B2SFINDER can be leveraged in detecting OSS reuse vulnerabilities in practice.", "author": [{"name": "Zimu Yuan", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Muyue Feng", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Feng Li", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Gu Ban", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Yang Xiao", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Shiyang Wang", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Qian Tang", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "He Su", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Chendong Yu", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Jiahuan Xu", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Aihua Piao", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Jingling Xuey", "affiliation": "University of New South Wales"}, {"name": "Wei Huo", "affiliation": "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"Finding software license violations through binary code clone detection\"", "authors": ["A.

Reviewers usually suffer from numerous, tangled and loosely related code changes that are bundled in a single commit, which makes code review very difficult. In this paper, we propose CoRA (Code Review Assistant), an automatic approach to decompose a commit into different parts and generate concise descriptions for reviewers. More specifically, CoRA can decompose a commit into independent parts (e.g., bug fixing, new feature adding, or refactoring) by code dependency analysis and tree-based similar-code detection, then identify the most important code changes in each part based on the PageRank algorithm and heuristic rules. As a result, CoRA can generate a concise description for each part of the commit. We evaluate our approach in seven open source software projects and 50 code commits. The results indicate that CoRA can improve the accuracy of decomposing code changes by 6.3% over the state-ofart practice. At the same time, CoRA can identify the important part from the fine-grained code changes with a mean average precision (MAP) of 87.7%. We also conduct a human study with eight participants to evaluate the performance and usefulness of CoRA, the user feedback indicates that CoRA can effectively help reviewers.", "author": [{"name": "Min Wang", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Condence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China and the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Zeqi Lin", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Yanzhen Zou", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Condence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China and the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Bing Xie", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High Condence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China and the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"}], "time": "Nov. 2019", "citationCount": 0, "references": [{"title": " \"How Do Software Engineers Understand Code Changes?:An Exploratory Study in Industry\"", "authors": ["Yida Tao", " Yingnong Dang", " Tao Xie", " Dongmei Zhang ", " Sunghun Kim"]}, {"title": " \"Tree edit distance: Robust and memory-efficient[J]\"", "authors": ["M Pawlik ", " N.

However, quality and reliability issues of RNNs make them vulnerable to adversarial attacks and hinder their deployment in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a quantitative analysis framework - DeepStellar - to pave the way for effective quality and security analysis of software systems powered by RNNs. DeepStellar is generic to handle various RNN architectures, including LSTM and GRU, scalable to work on industrial-grade RNN models, and extensible to develop customized analyzers and tools. We demonstrated that, with DeepStellar, users are able to design efficient test generation tools, and develop effective adversarial sample detectors.

To reduce the cost of adapting scripts for various platforms, some existing tools apply conventional computer vision techniques to replay the same script on multiple platforms. However, because these solutions can hardly identify dynamic or similar widgets. It becomes difficult for engineers to apply them in practice. In this paper, we present an image-driven tool, namely LIRAT, to record and replay test scripts cross platforms, solving the problem of test script cross-platform replay for the first time. LIRAT records screenshots and layouts of the widgets, and leverages image understanding techniques to locate them in the replay process. Based on accurate widget localization, LIRAT supports replaying test scripts across devices and platforms. We employed LIRAT to replay 25 scripts from 5 application across 8 Android devices and 2 iOS devices. The results show that LIRAT can replay 88% scripts on Android platforms and 60% on iOS platforms.

Currently, most black-box input generators adopt pseudo-random or brute-force searching strategies, which may take very long to find the correct combination of inputs that can drive the app into new and important states. We propose Humanoid, an automated black-box Android app testing tool based on deep learning. The key technique behind Humanoid is a deep neural network model that can learn how human users choose actions based on an app's GUI from human interaction traces. The learned model can then be used to guide test input generation to achieve higher coverage. Experiments on both open-source apps and market apps demonstrate that Humanoid is able to reach higher coverage, and faster as well, than the state-of-the-art test input generators.

One of the challenges for an efficient fuzzing is covering code guarded by constraints such as the magic number and nested conditions. Recently, academia has partially addressed the challenge via whitebox methods. However, high-level constraints such as array sorts, virtual function invocations, and tree set queries are yet to be handled. To meet this end, we present VisFuzz, an interactive tool for better understanding and intervening fuzzing process via real-time visualization. It extracts call graph and control flow graph from source code, maps each function and basic block to the line of source code and tracks real-time execution statistics with detail constraint contexts. With VisFuzz, test engineers first locate blocking constraints and then learn its semantic context, which helps to craft targeted inputs or update test drivers. Preliminary evaluations are conducted on four real-world programs in Google fuzzer-test-suite.

It is particularly salient in Free/Libre Open Source Software since the developers are distributed around the world, do not work for the same organization and, in most cases, never meet face to face. The existing solutions to expose developer reputation tend to be forge specific (GitHub), focus on activity instead of impact, do not leverage social or technical networks, and do not correct often misspelled developer identities. We aim to remedy this by amalgamating data from all public Git repositories, measuring the impact of developer work, expose developer's collaborators, and correct notoriously problematic developer identity data. We leverage World of Code (WoC), a collection of an almost complete (and continuously updated) set of Git repositories by first allowing developers to select which of the 34 million(M) Git commit author IDs belong to them and then generating their profiles by treating the selected collection of IDs as that single developer. As a side-effect, these selections serve as a training set for a supervised learning algorithm that merges multiple identity strings belonging to a single individual.
