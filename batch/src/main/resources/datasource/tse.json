Cola was designed to effect a correspondence between capabilities in Hydra and objects that are supported by the language. Cola is based on Smalltalk in that it uses message-passing as a control structure to allow syntactic freedom in the expression of commands to the system.

It is also known that data flow analysis cannot restrict attention to exactly those paths that are possible. It is, therefore, usual for analytic methods to consider aU paths. Sharper information can be obtained by considering a recursive set of paths that is large enough to include aUl possible paths, but smaU enough to exclude many of the impossible ones. This paper presents a simple uniform methodology for sharpening data flow information by considering certain recursive path sets of practical importance. Associated with each control flow arc there is a relation on a finite set Q. The paths that qualify to be considered are (essentially) those for which the composition of the relations encountered is nonempty. For example, Q might be the set of all assignments of values to each of several bit variables used by a program to remember some facts about the past and branch accordingly in the future. Given any data-flow problem together with qualifying relations on Q associated with the control flow arcs, we construct a new problem. Considering all paths in the new problem is equivalent to considering only qualifying paths in the old one. Preliminary experiments (with a smaUl set of real programs) indicate that qualified analysis is feasible and substantialy more informative than ordinary analysis.", "doi": "10.1109/TSE.1981.234509", "title": "Qualified Data Flow Problems", "publisher": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "author": [{"affiliation": "IBM Cambridge Scientific Center, Cambridge, MA, USA", "name": "L.H.

Fragmentation in secondary storage not only jeopardizes the allocation of space but also, since secondary storage access time\u2013unlike that in main storage\u2013is typically nonuniform, a decrease in efficiency arising from additional head movement may also result. A fragmented storage exhibits a checkerboard like pattern with free and occupied space alternating one another. Such alternating storage configuration is analyzed using alternating renewal processes. Two main types of storage processing are distinguished: contiguous storage allocation and noncontiguous storage allocation. The latter allows a request to be scattered over different locations while the former requires it to be allocated in a single continuous area. It is found that the reduction in operating efficiency due to fragmentation is quite substantial for both types of processing. The deterioration is especially marked in the former and is strongly affected by 1) the request size and 2) the storage utilization. Expressions for the generating functions of the performance penalties are derived.

Starting from the problem statement the valid inputs and outputs are specified by grammars, which can be combined to define the requisite translation. A notation for translation grammars is described informally which allows a translation to take into account semantic as well as syntactic information. Terminal symbols may be attributed by data types and may be qualified by Boolean expressions. The notation is capable of direct compilation but in this paper we show how it may be used to derive a program in a conventional high level language such as Pascal or Cobol. It is shown that more complex problems can be solved by simple pipeline structures of simple translations. Provided that nonbacktracking grammars are used to specify translations, the pipeline structure is well-suited to concurrent execution on a multiprocessor.

The maximization of this function would yield an optimal set of indexes. Unfortunately, algorithms known to solve this maximization problem require an order of time exponential in the total number of attributes in the file. Consequently, we develop the theoretical basis which leads to an algorithm that obtains a near optimal solution to the index selection problem in polynomial time. The theoretical result consists of showing that the index selection problem can be solved by solving a properly chosen instance of the knapsack problem. A theoretical bound for the amount by which the solution obtained by this algorithm deviates from the true optimum is provided.

In many cases it is desirable to keep the system functioning even when it is partitioned by network failures. A serious problem in this context is how one can support redundant copies of resources such as files (for the sake of reliability) while simultaneously monitoring their mutual consistency (the equality of multiple copies). This is difficult since network faiures can lead to inconsistency, and disrupt attempts at maintaining consistency. In fact, even the detection of inconsistent copies is a nontrivial problem. Naive methods either 1) compare the multiple copies entirely or 2) perform simple tests which will diagnose some consistent copies as inconsistent. Here a new approach, involving version vectors and origin points, is presented and shown to detect single file, multiple copy mutual inconsistency effectively.

The SIMD mode of parallelism involves using a large number of processors synchronized together. All processors execute the same instruction at the same time; however, each processor operates on a different data item. The complexity of parallel algorithms is, in general, a function of the machine size (number of processors), problem size, and type of interconnection network used to provide communications among the processors. Measures which quantify the effect of changing the machine-size/problem-size/network-type relationships are therefore needed. A number of such measures are presented and are applied to an example SIMD algorithm from the image processing problem domain.

Input rules are similar in appearance to production rules in grammars. The input expression specifies one or more input sequences, or input patterns, in terms of tool designators.

If a match between an input token and a tool designator is found, the corresponding tool body is executed, and the output is generated according to specifications in the tool body.

Nonprocedural programming languages are descriptive and devoid of procedural controls. They are therefore easier to use and require less programming skills than procedural languages. The MODEL language is briefly presented and illustrated followed by a description of the compilation process. An important early phase in the compilation is the representation of the specification by a dependency graph, denoted as array graph, which expresses the data flow interdependencies between statements. Two classes of algorithms which utilize this graph are next described. The first class checks various completeness, nonambiguity, and consistency aspects of the specification. Upon detecting any problems, the system attempts some automatic correcting measures which are reported to the user, or alternately, when no corrections appear as reasonable, it reports the error and solicits a modification from the user. The second class of algorithms produces an intermediate design of an object program in a language independent form.

Specifically, we examine the use of the on-line user (primarily text editor) data sets at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) computer installation through the analysis of 13 months of file reference data. We find that most files are used very few times. Of those that are used sufficiently frequently that their reference patterns may be examined, we find that: 1) about a third show declining rates of reference during their lifetime, 2) of the remainder, very few (about 5 percent) show correlated interreference intervals, and 3) interreference intervals (in days) appear to be more skewed than would occur with the Bernoulli process. Thus, about two-thirds of all suffi1ciently active files appear to be referenced as a renewal process with a skewed interreference distribution.

In order to take advantage of this diversity of processing power, a modular distributed program should have its modules assigned in such a way that the applicable system performance index, such as execution time or cost, is optimized. This paper describes an algorithm for making an optimal module to processor assignment for a given performance criteria. We first propose a computational model to characterize distributed programs, consisting of tasks and an operational precedence relationship. This model alows us to describe probabilistic branching as well as concurrent execution in a distributed program. The computational model along with a set of seven program descriptors completely specifies a model for dynamic execution of a program on a distributed system. The optimal task to processor assignment is found by an algorithm based on results in Markov decision theory.

For example, test paths which pass through an assignment statement \"X := f(Y)\" are incapable of revealing if the expression \"X -f( Y)\" has been added to later statements. In general, there are an infinite number of such undetectable error perturbations for any test path. However, when the chosen functional class of error expressions is a vector space, a finite characterization of all undetectable expressions can be found for one test path, or for combined testing along several paths.

In order to provide tolerance to software faults, some form of state restoration is usually advocated as a means of recovery. State restoration can be expensive and the cost is exacerbated for systems which utilize concurrent processes. The concurrency present in most real-time systems and the further difficulties introduced by timing constraints suggest that providing tolerance for software faults may be inordinately expensive or complex. We believe that this need not be the case, and propose a straightforward pragmatic approach to software fault tolerance'which is believed to be applicable to many real-time systems. The approach takes advantage of the structure of real-time systems to simplify error recovery, and a classification scheme for errors is introduced.

The proposed algorithm for-the computation of S*(Y) requires cubic time. The algorithm uses the recursively computable dissimilarity measure Dk(X, Y), termed as the kth distance between two strings X and Y which is a dissimilarity measure between Y and a certain subset of the set of contiguous substrings of X. Another estimate of T(U), namely SM(Y) is also suggested. The accuracy of SM(Y) is only slightly less than that of S*(Y), but the computation time of SM(Y) is substantially less than that of S*(Y).

Such models easily express most of the events occurring in protocol systems, including those of the users, their agent processes, and the communication channels. The paper reviews the basic concepts of state transition models and the AFFIRM formalism and methodology and describes their union.

This step traditionally involves investigating the expected performance of a system under different refinements of an abstraction and then selecting a single alternative which minimizes some performance cost metric. In this paper we reformulate this design step to allow different refinements of the same data abstraction within a computation. This reformulation reflects the fact that the implementation appropriate for a data abstraction is dependent on the behavior exhibited by the objects of the abstraction. Since this behavior can vary among the objects of a computation, a single refinement is often inappropriate. Accordingly, three frameworks are presented for understanding and representing variations in the behavior of objects and, thus, the potential for multiple implementations. The three frameworks are based upon: 1) a static partitioning of objects into disjoint implementation classes; 2) static partitioning of classes into implementation regions; and 3) dynamic partitioning of classes into implementation regions. These frameworks and analytic tools useful in investigating expected performance under multiple implementations are described in detail.", "doi": "10.1109/TSE.1983.234776", "title": "On the Multiple Implementation of Abstract Data Types Within a Computation", "publisher": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "author": [{"affiliation": "Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA", "name": "J.R.

The validation, using the source code for the UNIX operating system, shows that the complexity measures are strongly correlated with the occurrence of changes.

A specified program is called correct if: 1) the operational part is totally correct w.r.t. the pre-and postcondition, 2) the precondition guarantees nonabortion, 3) local assertions are adequate for the proof of 1) and 2). The requirement of nonabortion leads to the use of a three-valued predicate calculus. We use McCarthy's calculus in that place.

The main features of the approach indude the use of a formal specification language and the independent development of two sets of specifications. Analyses on the specifications consists of three-parts: validation against the functional requirements consistency and integrity of the specifications, and dual specification comparison based on a high-level symbolic execution technique. Dual design, implementation, and testing are performed. Automated tools to facilitate the validation and testing activities are developed to support the methodology. These includes the symbolic executor and test data generator/dual program monitor system.

It has three major parts. Section I describes the computational environment for the design and description of distributed graph algorithms in terms of an architectural model for message exchanges. The computational complexity is measured in terms of the number of messages transmitted. Section II presents several distributed algorithms for the pure traversal, depth-first search, and breadth-first search techniques. Their complexities are also given. Through these descriptions are brought out some of the intrinsic differences in the behaviors and complexities of the fundamental traversal techniques between a serial and a distributed computation environment. Section III gives the distributed version of the Ford and Fulkerson algorithm for the maximum flow problem by means of depth-first search, the largest-augmentation search and breadth-first search. The complexities of these methods are found to be 0(f*|A|), 0((l + logM/(M-1)f*|V||A|) and O(|V|6), respectively, where f* is the maximum flow value of the problem, M is the maximum number of ucs in a cut, |V| is the number of vertices, and |A| is the number of arcs. Lastly, it is shown that the largest augmentation search may be a better method than the other two. This is contrary to the known results in serial computation.", "doi": "10.1109/TSE.1983.234958", "title": "Graph Traversal Techniques and the Maximum Flow Problem in Distributed Computation", "publisher": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada", "name": "To-Yat Cheung"}], "keyword": ["Distributed computing", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Computational complexity", "Distributed algorithms", "Computer networks", "Concurrent computing", "Councils", "Computer science", "Computer architecture", "Software algorithms"], "time": "July 1983"},

In a system which uses a celiular-logic device as a means for data management applications, protection can be achieved in part by associating security windows with queries. This paper describes a mechanism for dynamically creating these windows for cellular-logic devices. The mechanism mainly benefits from the associative techniques such as content and context searches, tagging and marking data, etc. These techniques allow the windows to be created physically by simultaneously activating related access control decision procedures, which implement access control decisions employed by the system, to mask out those data to which the user does not have the right of access. Furthermore, they enable the content-dependent security decisions to be efficiently implemented, eliminating the drawbacks found in conventional systems. Thus, a query accessing to a protected database system is identical to a query accessing to its companion window.

The conventional Take-Grant mechanism for exercising such control suffers from a puzzling and unfortunate limitation: it cannot enforce strictly unidirectional channels for the flow of rights. That is, if rights can be moved directly or indirectly from some subject p to another subject q, then one cannot prevent rights from flowing in the opposite direction, from q to p. This property limits the applicability of this mechanism and therefore that of any protection scheme utilizing it. We analyze the nature and ramifications of this limitation and demonstrate that its root cause is the fact that (under this mechanism) a right possessed by a sender suffices to authorize a movement of rights. We propose an alternative, \"Take-Receive,\" model in which this limitation is eliminated, thus enabling the implementation of more useful protection disciplines.

An almost universally accepted way to ensure atomicity is to use a strict two-phase locking protocol with a roll-back scheme for recovery in case of deadlock or failure. In this note, we argue that this method is not the most economical way to achieve this end. We develop a Dependency Graph model which is used to analyze the two-phase and non-two-phase locking schemes. It is shown that one way of choosing between the two types of schemes is to estimate the number of rollbacks required. If this number is large, a two-phase scheme is preferable; if small, a non-two-phase scheme should be selected. We demonstrate that with reasonable discipline, the number of such rollbacks can be minimized. Thus, contrary to common practice and belief, non-two-phase protocols can be effectively used in guaranteeing atomicity.", "doi": "10.1109/TSE.1983.235107", "title": "A Case for Non-Two-Phase Locking Protocols that Ensure Atomicity", "publisher": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA", "name": "A.

We first give a notion of \"domain data compatibility\" which ensures that the ERD's in question represent the same universe of data in an aggregate sense. Then we define the set of functional dependencies which are naturally embedded in each ERD, and use it to develop a concept of \"data dependency equivalence\" which ensures that the ERD's satisfy the same constraints (functional dependencies) among the represented data. Finally, we give our strongest criterion, instance data equivalence, which requires the ERD's to have the same power to represent instances of data. We develop several alternate forms of this third notion, including some giving efficient tableaux tests for its occurrence.
